The data shows how different ChR variants respond to various light wavelengths, with some exhibiting stronger responses to certain wavelengths than others.\\n\\nc) The off-kinetics decay rate (τoff) is presented here, measured following a 1 ms exposure to 481 nm light. Parent ChRs are highlighted in light gray. An inset shows representative current traces for select ChRs, revealing distinct off-kinetics profiles. For example, ChR_21_10 turns off rapidly, ChR_25_9 and ChR_11_10 turn off more slowly, and ChR_15_10 shows little decrease in photocurrent 0.5 seconds after light exposure.\\n\\nd) This panel illustrates the normalized photocurrent as a function of wavelength for various ChR variants. It demonstrates how different ChRs respond to light across the spectrum from 400 nm to 600 nm.\\n\\ne) Peak photocurrent as a function of light intensity is shown for various ChR variants. This demonstrates how different ChRs respond to increasing light intensities from 0.1 mW/mm² to 10 mW/mm².\\n\\nf) Similar to panel (e), this shows the steady-state photocurrent as a function of light intensity for various ChR variants.\\n\\nThe figure highlights that the model-predicted ChRs exhibit a diverse range of properties, including variations in current strength, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics. Some designer variants show superior performance compared to the parental ChRs in certain aspects, demonstrating the success of the machine learning-guided optimization process.', source_nodes=[NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='817ee8cd-3048-43f8-8092-4f0cc636871a', embedding=None, metadata={'images': [], 'page_num': 22, 'parsed_section_title': 'References>Figure 1.', 'is_aux_text': True, 'summary': 'References to Figure 1 and Figure 2.', 'page_numbers': [22], 'fig_refs': ['Figure 1', 'Figure 2'], 'contains_fig_caption': False}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='Figure 2.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='[Excerpt from document]\\n{metadata_str}\\nExcerpt:\\n-----\\n{content}\\n-----\\n', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.5128654755603453), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='2f50f585-9ee2-47bc-b893-a45d6b2871dd', embedding=None, metadata={'images': [{'image_path': './storage/data_images/o4xovo-0.jpg', 'page_num': 22}], 'page_num': 22, 'is_aux_text': False, 'summary': 'The section describes various functional properties of model-predicted ChRs, including current traces, peak and steady-state photocurrents, off-kinetics decay rates, and normalized photocurrents for different wavelengths and light intensities.', 'page_numbers': [22], 'fig_refs': ['Figure 2'], 'contains_fig_caption': True}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"{'description': 'The model-predicted ChRs exhibit a large range of functional properties often far exceeding the parents.', 'title': 'Figure 2', 'type': 'summary'}\\n{'description': 'Representative current traces after 0.5 s light exposure for select designer ChR variants with corresponding expression and localization in HEK cells.

contact at a given position is weighted as likely to lead to, e.g., low (negative weight) or high (positive weight) photocurrents.\\nA number of residues and contacts most important for tuning spectral properties are proximal to the retinal-binding pocket, including the blue-shifting contact between A206 and F269 and the blue-shifting contact between F265 and I267 that are conserved in the blue-shifted parents C1C2 and CheRiff while the red-shifting contact between F201 and Y217 originates from the red-shifted CsChrimR parent (Supplemental Figure 4).\\nThe most heavily weighted contact contributing to off- kinetics includes the reside D195 (i.e., D156 according to ChR2 numbering) (Supplemental Figure 4), a residue that is part of the DC-gate1.\\nMutation of either the aspartic acid or cysteine within the DC-gate has been shown to decrease off-kinetic speed14,27.\\nWhile the cysteine in the DC-gate is conserved in all three ChR parents, the aspartic acid at position 195 is only conserved in CheRiff and C1C2 but not in CsChrimR, which has a cysteine at that position.\\nInterestingly, D195 is also part of a contact with L192 that contributes strongly to photocurrent strength

spectral properties are proximal to the retinal-binding pocket, including the blue-shifting contact between A206 and F269 and the blue-shifting contact between F265 and I267 that are conserved in the blue-shifted parents C1C2 and CheRiff while the red-shifting contact between F201 and Y217 originates from the red-shifted CsChrimR parent (Supplemental Figure 4).\\nThe most heavily weighted contact contributing to off- kinetics includes the reside D195 (i.e., D156 according to ChR2 numbering) (Supplemental Figure 4), a residue that is part of the DC-gate1.\\nMutation of either the aspartic acid or cysteine within the DC-gate has been shown to decrease off-kinetic speed14,27.\\nWhile the cysteine in the DC-gate is conserved in all three ChR parents, the aspartic acid at position 195 is only

The vertical scale bar represents 500 pA, and the horizontal scale bar represents 250 ms. Different colors are used to distinguish between variants, and these colors are consistent throughout the figure.\\n\\nb) Peak and Steady-State Photocurrents: This section displays measured peak and steady-state photocurrents for different wavelengths of light (397 nm, 481 nm, 546 nm, and 640 nm) in HEK cells. It shows how different ChR variants respond to various light wavelengths.\\n\\nc) Off-Kinetics Decay Rate: This panel presents the off-kinetics decay rate (τoff), measured following a 1 ms exposure to 481 nm light. Parent ChRs are highlighted in light gray. An inset shows representative current traces for select ChRs, revealing distinct off-kinetics profiles. For example:\\n   - ChR_21_10 turns off rapidly\\n   - ChR_25_9 and ChR_11_10 turn off more slowly\\n   - ChR_15_10 shows little decrease in photocurrent 0.5 seconds after light exposure\\n\\nd) Normalized Photocurrent vs. Wavelength: This panel illustrates the normalized photocurrent as a function of wavelength (from 400 nm to 600 nm) for various ChR variants, demonstrating their spectral sensitivity.\\n\\ne) Peak Photocurrent vs. Light Intensity: This shows how peak photocurrent changes with increasing light intensities (from 0.1 mW/mm² to 10 mW/mm²) for various ChR variants.\\n\\nf) Steady-State Photocurrent vs. Light Intensity: Similar to panel (e), but for steady-state photocurrent instead of peak photocurrent.\\n\\nThe key takeaway from Figure 2 is that the model-predicted ChRs exhibit a diverse range of properties, including variations in current strength, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics. Importantly, some designer variants show superior performance compared to the parental ChRs in certain aspects, demonstrating the success of the machine learning-guided optimization process.
