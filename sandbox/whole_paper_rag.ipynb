      "It's worth noting that the text mentions seven wavelengths, but I only see six distinct points on the plot. This discrepancy might be due to the 523 ± 6 nm (teal) wavelength mentioned in the text not being used in this particular plot, or it might be overlapping with another point.\n",

First, residues and contacts that covary were identified using the concatenated sequence and structure binary feature vector for each of the training set ChR variants.  Each set of covarying residues and contacts was combined into a single feature.  L1 linear regression was used to select the features that contribute most to each ChR functional property of interest.  The level of regularization was chosen by maximizing the log marginal likelihood of the Gaussian process regression model trained on the features selected at that level of regularization.  We then performed Bayesian ridge regression on the selected features using the default settings in scikit-learn47.  Residues and contacts with the largest absolute Bayesian ridge linear regression weights were plotted onto the C1C2 structure (Supplemental Figure 4).  For feature identification and weighting, models were trained on both the training set and also the test set of 28 ChR sequences predicted to have useful combinations of diverse properties.\\n\\n ## Statistical analysis\\n\\nPlotting and statistical analysis were done in Python 2.7 and 3.6 and GraphPad Prism 7.01.  For statistical comparisons, we first performed a D'Agostino & Pearson normality test.  If the p-value of a D'Agostino & Pearson normality test was < 0.05, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons post hoc test was used.  If the data passed the normality test, a one-way ANOVA was used.\\n\\n ## Data availability\\n\\nThe authors declare that data supporting the findings of this study are available within the paper and its supplementary information files.

First, residues and contacts that covary were identified using the concatenated sequence and structure binary feature vector for each of the training set ChR variants.  Each set of covarying residues and contacts was combined into a single feature.  L1 linear regression was used to select the features that contribute most to each ChR functional property of interest.  The level of regularization was chosen by maximizing the log marginal likelihood of the Gaussian process regression model trained on the features selected at that level of regularization.  We then performed Bayesian ridge regression on the selected features using the default settings in scikit-learn47.  Residues and contacts with the largest absolute Bayesian ridge linear regression weights were plotted onto the C1C2 structure (Supplemental Figure 4).

Systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB results in brain-wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections19,30,31.  Use of rAAV-PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited, however, by the low multiplicity of infection with systemically delivered viral vectors resulting in insufficient opsin expression and light-evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly-used channels (e.g.  ChR2).\\n\\n We hypothesized that the ChRgers could overcome this limitation and allow large-volume optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery.

ChRger2-expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons both in culture and in slice (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 6).

Recently, we described the AAV capsid rAAV-PHP.eB19 that produces broad transduction throughout the central nervous system with a single minimally-invasive intravenous injection in the adult mouse30,31.  Systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB results in brain-wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections19,30,31.  Use of rAAV-PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited, however, by the low multiplicity of infection with systemically delivered viral vectors resulting in insufficient opsin expression and light-evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly-used channels (e.g.  ChR2).\\n\\n We hypothesized that the ChRgers could overcome this limitation and allow large-volume optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery.  We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChRger1, ChRger2, CoChR, or ChR2(H134R) under the hSyn promoter and observed broad expression throughout the brain (Figure 3i).  We measured the fraction of opsin-expressing cells with sufficient opsin-mediated currents for light-induced firing (Figure 3j).  Only 4% of ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons produced light-induced firing, while 77% of CoChR-expressing neurons, 89% of ChRger1-expressing neurons, and 100% of ChRger2- or ChRger3-expressing neurons produced light-induced activity.  With systemic delivery, we observed superior light sensitivity of ChRgers compared with CoChR in both photocurrent strength (Figure 3k) and spike fidelity (Figure 3l).  ChRger2-expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons both in culture and in slice (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 6).  These results demonstrate the need for light-sensitive and high-photocurrent opsins for applications where systemic delivery is desired.\\n\\n We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging ChRger1–3 under the CaMKIIa promoter.  With systemic delivery of ChRger2, we observed photocurrent strength similar to results observed after direct injection into the PFC (Figure 3g).  When expressed in pyramidal neurons in the cortex, ChRger2 and ChRger3 enabled robust optically-induced firing at rates between 2–10 Hz, although spike fidelity was reduced at higher frequency stimulation (Figure 3m,n).  ChRger2 performed best with higher frequency stimulation while ChRger1 performed worst.  CoChR has better spike fidelity than the ChRgers at higher frequency stimulation (20–40 Hz) (Figure 3m).\\n\\n We next evaluated the optogenetic efficiency of ChRger2 after systemic delivery using optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation (oICSS) of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA)32.  We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging a double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) containing either ChRger2 or ChR2(H134R) into Dat-Cre mice (Figure 4a and Supplemental Table 5).  Three weeks after systemic delivery and stereotaxic implantation of fiber-optic cannulas above the VTA, mice were placed in an operant box and were conditioned to trigger a burst of 447 nm laser stimulation via nose poke.  Animals expressing ChRger2 displayed robust optogenetic self-stimulation in a frequency-dependent and laser power-dependent manner.  Higher frequencies (up to 20 Hz) and higher light power (up to 10 mW) promoted greater maximum operant response rates (Figure 4a).

Recently, we described the AAV capsid rAAV-PHP.eB19 that produces broad transduction throughout the central nervous system with a single minimally-invasive intravenous injection in the adult mouse30,31.  Systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB results in brain-wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections19,30,31.  Use of rAAV-PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited, however, by the low multiplicity of infection with systemically delivered viral vectors resulting in insufficient opsin expression and light-evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly-used channels (e.g.  ChR2).\\n\\n We hypothesized that the ChRgers could overcome this limitation and allow large-volume optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery.  We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChRger1, ChRger2, CoChR, or ChR2(H134R) under the hSyn promoter and observed broad expression throughout the brain (Figure 3i).

Only 4% of ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons produced light-induced firing, while 77% of CoChR-expressing neurons, 89% of ChRger1-expressing neurons, and 100% of ChRger2- or ChRger3-expressing neurons produced light-induced activity.  With systemic delivery, we observed superior light sensitivity of ChRgers compared with CoChR in both photocurrent strength (Figure 3k) and spike fidelity (Figure 3l).  ChRger2-expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons both in culture and in slice (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 6).

With systemic delivery of ChRger2, we observed photocurrent strength similar to results observed after direct injection into the PFC (Figure 3g).

As a metric for the ChR activation spectrum, the normalized current strength induced by exposure to green light (546 nm) was used (Figure 1a).

Light pulse duration, wavelength, and power were varied depending on the experiment (as described in the text).  Light pulses were generated using a Lumencor SPECTRAX light engine.  The illumination/output spectra for each color were measured (Supplemental Figure 5).  To evaluate normalized green photocurrent, we measured photocurrent strength at three wavelengths (peak ± half width at half maximum): (red) 640 ± 3 nm, (green) 546 ± 16 nm, and (cyan) 481 ± 3 nm with a 0.5 s light pulse.  Light intensity was matched for these measurements, with 481 nm light at 2.3 mW mm−2, 546 nm light at 2.8 mW mm−2, and 640 nm light at 2.2 mW mm−2.  For full spectra measurements depicted in Figure 2e, we measured photocurrents at seven different wavelengths (peak ± half width half maximum): (red) 640 ± 3 nm, (yellow) 567 ± 13 nm, (green) 546 ± 16 nm, (teal) 523 ± 6 nm, (cyan) 481 ± 3 nm LED, (blue) 439 ± 8 nm LED, and (violet) 397 ± 3 nm with a 0.5 s light pulse for each color.

Only neurons with an uncompensated series resistance between 5 and 25 MΩ, Rm > 90 MΩ, and holding current >−150 pA (holding at −60 mV) were included in data analysis (Supplemental Figures 10).  The photocurrent amplitude was not adjusted for expression level since both expression and conductance contribute to the in vivo utility of the tool.  However, comparisons of expression with photocurrent strength for all ChR variants tested are included in Supplemental Figures 6–7.  As metrics of photocurrent strength, peak and steady-state photocurrent were used (Figure 1a).  As a metric for the ChR activation spectrum, the normalized current strength induced by exposure to green light (546 nm) was used (Figure 1a).  Two parameters were used to characterize ChR off-kinetics: the time to reach 50% of the light-activated current and the photocurrent decay rate, τoff (Figure 1a).\\n\\n ## AAV production and purification\\n\\nProduction of recombinant AAV-PHP.eB packaging pAAV-hSyn-X-TS-eYFP-WPRE, pAAV-CAG-DIO[X-TS-eYFP]-WPRE, and pAAV-CaMKIIa-X-TS-eYFP-WPRE (X = ChR2(H134R), CoChR, ChRger1, ChRger2, and ChRger3) was done following the methods described in Deverman et al.42 and Challis et al.31.

Recently, we described the AAV capsid rAAV-PHP.eB19 that produces broad transduction throughout the central nervous system with a single minimally-invasive intravenous injection in the adult mouse30,31.  Systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB results in brain-wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections19,30,31.  Use of rAAV-PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited, however, by the low multiplicity of infection with systemically delivered viral vectors resulting in insufficient opsin expression and light-evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly-used channels (e.g.  ChR2).\\n\\n We hypothesized that the ChRgers could overcome this limitation and allow large-volume optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery.

We measured the fraction of opsin-expressing cells with sufficient opsin-mediated currents for light-induced firing (Figure 3j).  Only 4% of ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons produced light-induced firing, while 77% of CoChR-expressing neurons, 89% of ChRger1-expressing neurons, and 100% of ChRger2- or ChRger3-expressing neurons produced light-induced activity.

ChRger2-expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons both in culture and in slice (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 6).

Animals expressing ChRger2 displayed robust optogenetic self-stimulation in a frequency-dependent and laser power-dependent manner.  Higher frequencies (up to 20 Hz) and higher light power (up to 10 mW) promoted greater maximum operant response rates (Figure 4a).

Current ChR tools applied to the mammalian brain require intracranial surgery for transgene delivery and implantation of invasive fiber-optic cables to produce light-dependent activation of a small volume of tissue. To facilitate expansive optogenetics without the need for invasive implants, our engineering approach leverages the significant literature of ChR variants to train statistical models for the design of new, high-performance ChRs. With Gaussian Process models trained on a limited experimental set of 102 functionally characterized ChRs, we designed high-photocurrent ChRs with unprecedented light sensitivity; three of these, ChRger1–3, enable optogenetic activation of the nervous system via minimally-invasive systemic transgene delivery, not possible previously due to low per-cell transgene copy produced by systemic delivery. ChRger2 enables light-induced neuronal excitation without invasive intracranial surgery for virus delivery or fiber optic implantation, i.e. enables minimally-invasive optogenetics.\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nChannelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels found in photosynthetic algae. Transgenic expression of ChRs in the brain enables light-dependent neuronal activation1.

These channels have broad activation spectra in the visible range and require high-intensity light for activation [~1 mW mm−2]. ChRs are naturally low-conductance channels requiring approximately 105–106 functional ChRs expressed in the plasma-membrane of a neuron to produce sufficient light-dependent depolarization to induce neuronal activation3. When applied to the mouse brain, ChRs require ~1–15 mW light delivered ~100 μm from the target cell population to reliably activate action potentials4–6. This confines light-dependent activation to a small volume of brain tissue [~1 mm3]7. Enabling optogenetics for large brain volumes without the need to implant invasive optical fibers for light delivery would be highly desirable for neuroscience applications.\\n\\nEngineering ChRs to overcome limits in conductance and light sensitivity and extend the reach of optogenetic experiments requires overcoming three major challenges. First, rhodopsins are trans-membrane proteins that are inherently difficult to engineer because the sequence and structural determinants of membrane protein expression and plasma-membrane localization are highly constrained and poorly understood8,9. Second, because properties of interest for neuroscience applications are assayed using low-throughput techniques, such as patch-clamp electrophysiology, engineering by directed evolution is not feasible10. And third, in vivo applications require retention and optimization of multiple properties, for example, localization in mammalian cells while simultaneously tuning kinetics, photocurrents, and spectral properties6.\\n\\nDiverse ChRs have been published, including variants discovered from nature11,12, variants engineered through recombination9,13 and mutagenesis14,15, as well as variants resulting from rational design16. Studies of these coupled with structural information17 and molecular dynamic simulations18 have established some understanding of the mechanics and sequence features important for specific ChR properties1,16. Despite this, it is still not possible to predict functional properties of new ChR sequences.\\n\\nOur approach has been to leverage the significant literature of ChRs to train statistical models that enable design of highly-functional ChRs. These models take as their input the sequence and structural information for a given ChR variant and then predict its functional properties. The models use training data to learn how sequence and structural elements map to ChR function. Once known, that mapping can be used to predict the behavior of untested ChR variants.\\n\\nWe trained models in this manner and found that they accurately predict the properties of untested ChR sequences. We used these models to engineer 30 'designer' ChR variants with specific combinations of desired properties, a number of which have unprecedented photocurrent strength and light sensitivity. We characterized these low-light sensitive, high-photocurrent ChRs for applications in the mammalian brain and demonstrate their potential for minimally-invasive activation of populations of neurons in the brain enabled by systemic transgene delivery with the engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV), rAAV-PHP.eB19. This work demonstrates how a machine learning-guided approach can enable engineering of proteins that have been challenging to engineer.\\n\\nNat Methods.

These recombination libraries are a rich source of functionally diverse sequences9. Previously, we generated 102 ChR variants selected from these recombination libraries8,9, 76 of these were previously characterized for photocurrent properties (with patch-clamp electrophysiology) and 26 we characterized here. Together, these 102 ChR recombination variants provide the primary dataset used for model training. We supplemented this dataset with data from other published sources including 19 ChR variants from nature, 14 single-mutant ChR variants, and 28 recombination variants from other libraries (Dataset 1). As the data produced by other labs were not collected under the same experimental conditions as data collected in our hands, they cannot be used for comparison for absolute ChR properties (i.e. photocurrent strength); however, these data do provide useful binary information on whether a sequence variant is functional or not. Thus, we used published data from other sources when training binary classification models for ChR function.\\n\\nBecause our goal was to optimize photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics, we used these measured properties to train machine-learning models (Figure 1a). Enhancing ChR photocurrent strength would enable reliable neuronal activation even under low-light conditions. Different off-rates can be useful for specific applications: fast off-kinetics enable high-frequency optical stimulation23, slow off-kinetics is correlated with increased light sensitivity3,14,15, and very slow off-kinetics can be used for constant depolarization (step-function opsins [SFOs]14). In addition to opsin functional properties, it is also necessary to optimize or maintain plasma-membrane localization, a prerequisite for ChR function8.\\n\\n## Training Gaussian process (GP) classification and regression models\\n\\nUsing the ChR sequence/structure and functional data as inputs, we trained Gaussian process (GP) classification and regression models (Figure 1). GP models successfully predicted thermostability, substrate binding affinity, and kinetics for several soluble enzymes24, and, more recently, ChR membrane localization8. For a detailed description of the GP model architecture used for protein engineering see refs 8, 24. Briefly, these models infer predictive values for new sequences from training examples by assuming that similar inputs (ChR sequence variants) will have similar outputs (photocurrent properties). To quantify the relatedness of inputs (ChR sequence variants), we compared both sequence and structure. ChR sequence information is encoded in the amino acid sequence. For structural comparisons, we convert the 3D crystal-structural information into a 'contact map' that is convenient for modeling. Two residues are considered to be in contact and potentially important for structural and functional integrity if they have any non-hydrogen atoms within 4.5 Å in the C1C2 crystal structure (3UG9.pdb)17. We defined the sequence and structural\\n\\nNat Methods.

We then used this trained classification model to predict whether uncharacterized ChR sequence variants were functional (Figure 1b). To test prediction accuracy, we performed 20-fold cross validation on the training data set and achieved an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.78, indicating good predictive power (Supplemental Table 1).\\n\\nNext, we trained three regression models, one for each of the ChR photocurrent properties of interest: photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity of photocurrents, and off-kinetics (Figure 1c). Once trained, these models were used to predict photocurrent properties of new, untested ChRs sequence variants. To test prediction accuracy, we performed 20-fold cross validation on the training dataset and observed high correlation between predicted and measured properties for all models (Pearson correlation [R] between 0.77-0.9; Supplemental Table 1-2). Models built using contact maps from either the ChR2 crystal structure25 or C1Chrimson crystal structure26 perform as well as models built with a contact map from the C1C2 structure17 (Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Figure 1c,d) even though these maps share only 82% and 89% of their contacts with the C1C2 map, respectively (Supplemental Figure 1a,b).\\n\\n## Selection of designer ChRs using trained models\\n\\nTo select 'designer' ChRs (i.e. ChRs predicted to have a useful combination of properties), we used a tiered approach (Figure 1d). First, we eliminated all ChR sequences predicted to not localize to the plasma membrane or predicted to be non-functional. To do this, we used classification models of ChR localization8 and function to predict the probability of localization and function for each ChR sequence in the 120,000-variant recombination library. Not surprisingly, most ChR variants were predicted to not localize and not function. To focus on ChR variants predicted to localize and function, we set a threshold for the product of the predicted probabilities of localization and function (Figure 1b); any ChR sequence above that threshold would be considered for the next tier of the process. We selected a conservative threshold of 0.4.\\n\\nThe training data made clear that the higher the mutation distance from one of the three parents, the less likely it was that a sequence would be functional; however, we expect that more diverse sequences would also have the more diverse functional properties. To explore diverse sequences predicted to function, we selected 22 ChR variants that passed the 0.4 threshold and were multi-block-swap sequences containing on average 70 mutations from the closest parent. These 22 sequences were synthesized, expressed in HEK cells, and their photocurrent properties were measured with patch-clamp electrophysiology. 59% of the tested sequences were functional (Figure 1e), compared to 38% of the multi-block swap sequences randomly selected (i.e., not selected by the model) and having comparable average mutation level. This validates the classification model's ability to make useful predictions about novel functional sequences, even for sequences that are very distant from the parents.\\n\\nNat Methods.

We updated the models by including data from these 22 sequences for future rounds of predictions.\\n\\nFrom the 120,000-variant recombination library, 1,161 chimeric sequence variants passed the conservative 0.4 predicted localization and function threshold (Figure 1). For the second tier of the selection process, we used the three regression models trained on all functional variants collected up to this point to predict the photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity of photocurrents, and off-kinetics for each of these 1,161 ChR sequence variants (Dataset 3). We selected 28 designer ChRs predicted to be highly functional with different combinations of properties including those predicted to have the highest photocurrent strength, most red-shifted or blue-shifted activation wavelengths, and off-kinetics from very fast to very slow (Supplemental Figure 2–3).\\n\\nGenes encoding the 28 selected designer ChR variants were synthesized, expressed in HEK cells, and characterized for their photocurrent properties with patch-clamp electrophysiology. All 28 selected designer ChRs were functional: 100% of variants selected using the updated classification model above the 0.4 threshold both localize and function. For each of the designer ChR variants, the measured photocurrent properties correlated well with the model predictions (R>0.9 for all models) (Figure 1f, Supplemental Table 1). This outstanding performance on a novel set of sequences demonstrates the power of this data-driven predictive method for engineering designer ChRs. As a negative control, we selected two ChR variant sequences from the recombination library that the model predicted would be non-functional (ChR_29_10 and ChR_30_10). These sequences resulted from a single-block swap from two of the most highly functional ChR recombination variants tested. As predicted, these sequences were non-functional (Figure 2b), which shows that ChR functionality can be attenuated by incorporating even minimal diversity at certain positions.\\n\\n## Sequence and structural determinants of ChR functional properties\\n\\nWe used L1-regularized linear regression models to identify a limited set of residues and structural contacts that strongly influence ChR photocurrent strength, spectral properties, and off-kinetics (Supplemental Figure 4a). We can assess the relative importance of each of these sequence and structural features by weighting their contributions using L2-regularized linear regression (Dataset 4 and Supplemental Figure 4). For each functional property, we identified a set of important residues and contacts and their respective weights. A specific residue or contact at a given position is weighted as likely to lead to, e.g., low (negative weight) or high (positive weight) photocurrents. A number of residues and contacts most important for tuning spectral properties are proximal to the retinal-binding pocket, including the blue-shifting contact between A206 and F269 and the blue-shifting contact between F265 and I267 that are conserved in the blue-shifted parents C1C2 and CheRiff while the red-shifting contact between F201 and Y217 originates from the red-shifted CsChrimR parent (Supplemental Figure 4). The most heavily weighted contact contributing to off-kinetics includes the reside D195 (i.e., D156 according to ChR2 numbering) (Supplemental Figure 4), a residue that is part of the DC-gate¹. Mutation of either the aspartic acid or cysteine within the DC-gate has been shown to decrease off-kinetic speed¹⁴,²⁷. While the cysteine in the DC-gate is conserved in all three ChR parents, the aspartic acid at position\\n\\nNat Methods.

Interestingly, D195 is also part of a contact with L192 that contributes strongly to photocurrent strength (Supplemental Figure 4). A number of contacts proximal to retinal contribute strongly to photocurrent strength. For example, the most heavily weighted contact includes A295 (from CsChrimR), which is adjacent to the conserved lysine residue that covalently links retinal (Supplemental Figure 4). This position is a serine in both C1C2 and CheRiff.\\n\\n## Machine-guided search identifies ChRs with a range of useful functional properties\\n\\nWe assessed photocurrent amplitude, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics of the designer ChRs and the three parental ChRs (Figure 2). In addition to the 28 regression model-predicted ChRs, we also assessed the two top-performing ChRs from the classification models' predictions (ChR_9_4 and ChR_25_9), for a total of 30 highly-functional model-predicted ChRs as well as the two negative control ChRs (ChR_29_10, ChR_30_10). Of the 30 model-predicted ChRs, we found 12 variants with ≥2-times higher blue-light activated photocurrents than the top-performing parent (CsChrimR) (Figure 2b). Three variants exhibit ≥1.7-times higher green-light activated photocurrents than CsChrimR. Eight variants have larger red-light activated photocurrents when compared with the blue-light activated parents (CheRiff and C1C2), though none out-perform CsChrimR. Both ChR variants predicted to be non-functional by the models produce <30 pA currents.\\n\\nDesigner ChRs' off-kinetics span three orders of magnitude (τoff = 10 ms – >10 s) (Figure 2c). This range is quite remarkable given that all designer ChRs are built from sequence blocks of three parents that have similar off-kinetics (τoff = 30–50 ms). We found that 5 designer ChRs have faster off-kinetics than the fastest parent, while 16 have >5-times slower off-kinetics. The two fastest variants, ChR_3_10 and ChR_21_10 exhibit τoff = 13±0.9 ms and 12±0.4 ms, respectively (mean±SEM). Four ChRs have particularly slow off-kinetics with τoff > 1 s, including ChR_15_10, ChR_6_10, and ChR_13_10 (τoff = 4.3±0.1 s, 8.0±0.5 s, and 17±7 s, respectively). Two ChRs with very large photocurrents, ChR_25_9 and ChR_11_10, exhibit τoff = 220±10 ms and 330±30 ms, respectively.\\n\\nThree designer ChRs exhibit interesting spectral properties (Figure 2e, Supplemental Figure 5). ChR_28_10's red-shifted spectrum matches that of CsChrimR, demonstrating that incorporating sequence elements from blue-shifted ChRs into CsChrimR can still generate a red-shifted activation spectrum. Two designer ChRs exhibit novel spectral properties: ChR_11_10 has a broad activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with similar steady-state current strength from 400–546 nm light and strong currents (700 ± 100 pA) when activated with 567 nm light. ChR_25_9, on the other hand, exhibits a narrow activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with a peak at 481 nm light.\\n\\nWe assessed the light sensitivity of select designer ChRs. Compared with CsChrimR, CheRiff, and C1C2, the designer ChRs have ≥9-times larger currents at the lowest intensity of light tested (10^-1 mW mm^-2), larger currents at all intensities of light tested, and minimal decrease in photocurrent magnitude over the range of intensities tested (10^-1–10^1 mW mm^-2), suggesting that photocurrents were saturated at these intensities and would only attenuate at much lower light intensities (Figure 2d).

The selected designer ChRs produce 3–6x larger photocurrents than ChR2(H134R) when exposed to high-intensity (2.2 mW mm−2) 481 nm light and 10–18x larger photocurrents than ChR2(H134R) when exposed to low-intensity (6.5×10−2 mW mm−2) 481 nm light (Supplemental Figure 8f,g). Although CoChR produced peak currents of similar magnitude to the designer ChRs, CoChR decays to a much lower steady-state level (Supplemental Figure 8d,e) with the designer ChRs producing 2–3x larger steady-state photocurrents than CoChR when exposed to high-intensity light and 3–4x larger steady-state photocurrents than CoChR when exposed to low-intensity light (Supplemental Figure 8f,g; Supplemental Table 4). The increased low-light sensitivity of these select designer ChRs is likely due in part to their relatively slow off-kinetics leading to the increased accumulation of the open state under low-light conditions14.\\n\\n## Validation of designer ChRs for neuroscience applications\\n\\nFor further validation we selected three of the top high-conductance ChRs, ChR_9_4, ChR_25_9, and ChR_11_10, and renamed them ChRger1, ChRger2, and ChRger3, respectively, for channelrhodopsin Gaussian process-engineered recombinant opsin (Supplemental Figure 9). When expressed in cultured neurons, the ChRgers display robust membrane localization and expression throughout the neuron soma and neurites (Figure 3b). The ChRgers outperform both CoChR and ChR2(H134R) in photocurrent strength with low-intensity light in neuronal cultures (Figure 3c). The designer ChRgers require 1–2 orders of magnitude lower light intensity than CoChR and ChR2(H134R) for neuronal activation (Figure 3d, Supplemental Figure 8h).\\n\\nNext, we performed direct intracranial injections into the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChRger1–3, or ChR2(H134R) under the hSyn promoter (Supplemental Table 5). After 3–5 weeks of expression, we measured light sensitivity in ChR-expressing neurons in acute brain slices. We observed greater light sensitivity for the ChRgers compared with ChR2(H134R) (Figure 3g,h). The ChRgers exhibit >200 pA photocurrent at 10−3 mW mm−2 while at the equivalent irradiance ChR2(H134R) exhibits undetectable photocurrents. The ChRgers reach >1000 pA photocurrents with ~10−2 mW mm−2 light, a four-fold improvement over ChR2(H134R)'s irradiance-matched photocurrents (Figure 3g). Our characterization of ChR2(H134R)'s light sensitivity and photocurrent strength is consistent with previous results from other labs6,22.\\n\\n## Designer ChRs and systemic AAVs enable minimally-invasive optogenetic excitation\\n\\nWe investigated whether these light-sensitive, high-photocurrent ChRs could provide optogenetic activation coupled with minimally-invasive gene delivery.

Recently, we described the AAV capsid rAAV-PHP.eB19 that produces broad transduction throughout the central nervous system with a single minimally-invasive intravenous injection in the adult mouse30,31. Systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB results in brain-wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections19,30,31. Use of rAAV-PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited, however, by the low multiplicity of infection with systemically delivered viral vectors resulting in insufficient opsin expression and light-evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly-used channels (e.g. ChR2).\\n\\nWe hypothesized that the ChRgers could overcome this limitation and allow large-volume optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery. We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChRger1, ChRger2, CoChR, or ChR2(H134R) under the hSyn promoter and observed broad expression throughout the brain (Figure 3i). We measured the fraction of opsin-expressing cells with sufficient opsin-mediated currents for light-induced firing (Figure 3j). Only 4% of ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons produced light-induced firing, while 77% of CoChR-expressing neurons, 89% of ChRger1-expressing neurons, and 100% of ChRger2- or ChRger3-expressing neurons produced light-induced activity. With systemic delivery, we observed superior light sensitivity of ChRgers compared with CoChR in both photocurrent strength (Figure 3k) and spike fidelity (Figure 3l). ChRger2-expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons both in culture and in slice (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 6). These results demonstrate the need for light-sensitive and high-photocurrent opsins for applications where systemic delivery is desired.\\n\\nWe systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging ChRger1–3 under the CaMKIIa promoter. With systemic delivery of ChRger2, we observed photocurrent strength similar to results observed after direct injection into the PFC (Figure 3g). When expressed in pyramidal neurons in the cortex, ChRger2 and ChRger3 enabled robust optically-induced firing at rates between 2–10 Hz, although spike fidelity was reduced at higher frequency stimulation (Figure 3m,n). ChRger2 performed best with higher frequency stimulation while ChRger1 performed worst. CoChR has better spike fidelity than the ChRgers at higher frequency stimulation (20–40 Hz) (Figure 3m).\\n\\nWe next evaluated the optogenetic efficiency of ChRger2 after systemic delivery using optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation (oICSS) of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA)32. We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging a double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) containing either ChRger2 or ChR2(H134R) into DAT-Cre mice (Figure 4a and Supplemental Table 5). Three weeks after systemic delivery and stereotaxic implantation of fiber-optic cannulas above the VTA, mice were placed in an operant box and were conditioned to trigger a burst of 447 nm laser stimulation via nose poke. Animals expressing ChRger2 displayed robust optogenetic self-stimulation in a frequency-dependent and laser power-dependent manner. Higher frequencies (up to 20 Hz) and higher light power (up to 10 mW) promoted greater maximum operant response rates (Figure 4a). Conversely, laser stimulation failed to reinforce operant responding in ChR2(H134R)-expressing animals (Figure 4a); these results were consistent with results in\\n\\nNat Methods.

In this assay, unilateral stimulation of M2 disrupts motor function in the contralateral lower extremities, causing mice to turn away from the stimulation side. We systemically administered rAAV-PHPeB packaging either ChRger2 or ChR2(H134R) under a CaMKIIa promoter for transgene expression in excitatory pyramidal neurons in the cortex (Figure 4b, and Supplemental Table 5). We observed broad expression throughout the cortex for both ChRger2 and ChR2(H134R) injected animals (Supplemental Figure 11). We secured a fiber-optic cannula guide to the surface of the thinned skull above M2 without puncturing the dura and therefore leaving the brain intact (Figure 4b), which we consider to be minimally invasive. Despite the presence of the highly optically scattering calavarial bone, stimulation with 20 mW 447 nm light induced left-turning behavior in animals expressing ChRger2 but not in animals expressing ChR2(H134R) (Figure 4b and Supplemental Video 1–2). Left-turning behavior terminated upon conclusion of optical stimulation (Supplemental Video 1). Behavioral effects were seen at powers as low as 10 mW. To ensure that the turning behavior was not due to visual stimuli or heating caused by the stimulation laser, we repeated treadmill experiments using 671 nm light, which is outside the excitation spectrum of both opsins. 20 mW 671 nm light failed to induce turning in both ChRger2 and ChR2(H124R). Overall, these experiments demonstrate that ChRger2 is compatible with minimally-invasive systemic gene delivery and can enable minimally-invasive optogenetic excitation. Coupling ChRgers with recently reported upconversion nanoparticles may allow for non-invasive optogenetics in deep brain areas with systemic transgene delivery and tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light for neuronal excitation29.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nWe demonstrated a data-driven approach to engineering ChR properties that enables efficient discovery of highly functional ChR variants based on data from relatively few variants. In this approach we approximate the ChR fitness landscape for a set of ~120,000 chimeric ChRs and use it to efficiently search sequence space and select top-performing variants for a given property10,24,34. By first eliminating the vast majority of non-functional sequences, we can focus on local peaks scattered throughout the landscape. Then, using regression models, we predict which sequences lie on the fitness peaks.\\n\\nMachine learning provides a platform for simultaneous optimization of multiple ChR properties that follow engineering specifications. We were able to generate variants with large variations in off-kinetics (10 ms to >10 s) and photocurrents that far exceed any of the parental or other commonly used ChRs. We also use the machine-learning models to identify the residues and contacts most important for ChR function. Application of this machine-learning pipeline (limited data collection from diverse sequences, model training and validation, and prediction and testing of new sequences) has great potential to optimize other\\n\\nNat Methods.

The high-photocurrent properties of these ChRs overcome the limitation of low per-cell copy number after systemic delivery.

The 10-block contiguous and 10-block noncontiguous recombination libraries were designed and built using SCHEMA recombination9. Software packages for calculating SCHEMA energies are openly available at cheme.che.caltech.edu/groups/fha/Software.htm. Each chimeric ChR variant in these libraries is composed of blocks of sequence from the parental ChR (CsChrimR11, C1C217, and CheRiff22), including chimeras with single-block swaps (chimeras consisting of 9 blocks of one parent and a single block from one of the other two parents) and multi-block-swap chimera sequences.\\n\\nSelected ChR variant genes were inserted into a constant vector backbone [pFCK from Addgene plasmid #51693] with a CMV promoter, Golgi export trafficking signal (TS) sequence (KSRITSEGEYIPLDQIDINV)5, and fluorescent protein (mKate). All ChR variants contain the SpyTag sequence following the N-terminal signal peptide for the SpyTag/SpyCatcher labeling assays used to characterize ChR membrane localization9,36. The C1C2 parent for the recombination libraries is mammalian codon-optimized. ChR variant sequences used in this study are documented in Dataset 2. All selected ChR genes were synthesized and cloned in the pFCK mammalian expression vector by Twist Bioscience. For visualization, sequence alignment between C1C2 and designer ChRs were created using ClustalQ and visualized using ENDscript37 (Supplemental Figure 1c,d).\\n\\nFor characterization in neurons, selected ChR variants [ChRger1, ChRger2, ChRger3, CoChR11, and hChR2(H134R)] were inserted into a pAAV-hSyn vector backbone [Addgene plasmid #26973], a pAAV-CamKIIa vector backbone [Addgene plasmid #51087], and a pAAV-CAG-DIO vector backbone [Addgene plasmid #104052]. In all backbones, each ChR was inserted with a TS sequence5 and fluorescent protein (eYFP).\\n\\n## HEK293T cell and primary neuronal cultures\\n\\nThe culturing and characterization ChRs in HEK cells is described in Bedbrook et al9,36.

To evaluate normalized green photocurrent, we measured photocurrent strength at three wavelengths (peak ± half width at half maximum): (red) 640 ± 3 nm, (green) 546 ± 16 nm, and (cyan) 481 ± 3 nm with a 0.5 s light pulse.

Only neurons with an uncompensated series resistance between 5 and 25 MΩ, Rin > 90 MΩ, and holding current >−150 pA (holding at −60 mV) were included in data analysis (Supplemental Figures 10). The photocurrent amplitude was not adjusted for expression level since both expression and conductance contribute to the in vivo utility of the tool. However, comparisons of expression with photocurrent strength for all ChR variants tested are included in Supplemental Figures 6–7. As metrics of photocurrent strength, peak and steady-state photocurrent were used (Figure 1a). As a metric for the ChR activation spectrum, the normalized current strength induced by exposure to green light (546 nm) was used (Figure 1a).

Models built using structural encodings built from the ChR2 structure (6EID.pdb) and the C1Chrimson structure (5ZIH.pdb) performed as well as models using the C1C2 structure (Supplemental Figure 1c,d). The models are robust to differences in contact maps because they use both sequence and structural information, which is somewhat redundant.\\n\\nFor a given ChR, the contact map is simply a list of contacting amino acids with their positions. For example, a contact between alanine at position 134 and methionine at position 1 of the amino acid sequence would be encoded by [('A134'), ('M1')]. Both sequence and structural information were one-hot encoded. Regression models for ChR properties were trained to predict the logarithm of the measured properties.

We use Laplace's method to approximate the posterior distribution. Hyperparameters in the kernels are found by maximizing the marginal likelihood. Classification was implemented using open-source packages in the SciPy ecosystem44–46. The binary classification model was trained to predict if a ChR sequence is or is not functional. A ChR sequence was considered to be functional if its photocurrents were >100 pA upon light exposure, a threshold set as an approximate lower bound for current necessary for neuronal activation.\\n\\n## GP kernels for modeling proteins\\nGaussian process regression and classification models require kernel functions that measure the similarity between protein sequences. A protein sequence s of length L is defined by the amino acid present at each location. This can be encoded as a binary feature vector xaa that indicates the presence or absence of each amino acid at each position resulting in a vector of length 20L (for 20 possible amino acids). Likewise, the protein's structure can be represented as a residue-residue contact map. The contact map can be encoded as a binary feature vector xst that indicates the presence or absence of each possible contacting pair. Both the sequence and structure feature vectors were used by concatenating them to form a sequence-structure feature vector.\\n\\nThree types of kernel functions k(s, s') were considered: polynomial kernels, squared exponential kernels, and Matérn kernels. These different forms represent possible functions for the protein's fitness landscape. The polynomial kernel is defined as:\\n\\nk(s, s') = (σ02 + σp2xTx')d  (4)\\n\\nwhere σ0 and σp are hyperparameters. We considered polynomial kernels with d = 3. The squared exponential kernel is defined as:\\n\\nk(s, s') = σp2 exp(-(||x - x'||22) / l)  (5)\\n\\nwhere l and σp are also hyperparameters and ||·||2 is the L2 norm. Finally, the Matérn kernel with ν = 5/2 is defined as:\\n\\nk(s, s') = (1 + √5||x - x'||2 / l + 5||x - x'||22 / 3l2) exp(-√5||x - x'||2 / l)  (6)\\n\\nNat Methods.

First, residues and contacts that covary were identified using the concatenated sequence and structure binary feature vector for each of the training set ChR variants. Each set of covarying residues and contacts was combined into a single feature. L1 linear regression was used to select the features that contribute most to each ChR functional property of interest. The level of regularization was chosen by maximizing the log marginal likelihood of the Gaussian process regression model trained on the features selected at that level of regularization. We then performed Bayesian ridge regression on the selected features using the default settings in scikit-learn47. Residues and contacts with the largest absolute Bayesian ridge linear regression weights were plotted onto the C1C2 structure (Supplemental Figure 4). For feature identification and weighting, models were trained on both the training set and also the test set of 28 ChR sequences predicted to have useful combinations of diverse properties.\\n\\n## Statistical analysis\\n\\nPlotting and statistical analysis were done in Python 2.7 and 3.6 and GraphPad Prism 7.01. For statistical comparisons, we first performed a D'Agostino & Pearson normality test. If the p-value of a D'Agostino & Pearson normality test was < 0.05, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparisons post hoc test was used. If the data passed the normality test, a one-way ANOVA was used.\\n\\n## Data availability\\n\\nThe authors declare that data supporting the findings of this study are available within the paper and its supplementary information files.

(a) Upon light exposure, ChRs open and reach a peak inward current and then desensitize reaching a lower steady-state current. We use both peak and steady-state current as metrics for photocurrent strength. To evaluate ChR off-kinetics we used the current decay rate (τoff) after a 1 ms light exposure and also the time to reach 50% of the light-exposed current after light removal. As a metric for wavelength sensitivity of activation, we used the normalized photocurrent with green (546 nm) light, which easily differentiates blue-shifted ChRs (peak activation: ~450–480 nm) and red-shifted ChRs (peak activation: ~520–650 nm). (b) We trained classification models to predict whether ChRs would localize correctly to the plasma membrane and function (i.e., ChRs above the 0.4 threshold for the product of the predicted probabilities (pp) of localization and function). (c) We then trained regression models to approximate the fitness landscape for each property of interest for the recombination library (inset show hypothetical fitness landscapes). (b–e) Models were trained with photocurrent properties for each ChR in the training set (plots show 20-fold cross validation on the training set).

Current ChR tools applied to the mammalian brain require intracranial surgery for transgene delivery and implantation of invasive fiber-optic cables to produce light-dependent activation of a small volume of tissue. To facilitate expansive optogenetics without the need for invasive implants, our engineering approach leverages the significant literature of ChR variants to train statistical models for the design of new, high-performance ChRs. With Gaussian Process models trained on a limited experimental set of 102 functionally characterized ChRs, we designed high-photocurrent ChRs with unprecedented light sensitivity; three of these, ChRger1–3, enable optogenetic activation of the nervous system via minimally-invasive systemic transgene delivery, not possible previously due to low per-cell transgene copy produced by systemic delivery. ChRger2 enables light-induced neuronal excitation without invasive intracranial surgery for virus delivery or fiber optic implantation, i.e. enables minimally-invasive optogenetics.\\n\\n### Introduction\\n\\nChannelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels found in photosynthetic algae. Transgenic expression of ChRs in the brain enables light-dependent neuronal activation1.

These channels have broad activation spectra in the visible range and require high-intensity light for activation [~1 mW mm−2]. ChRs are naturally low-conductance channels requiring approximately 105–106 functional ChRs expressed in the plasma-membrane of a neuron to produce sufficient light-dependent depolarization to induce neuronal activation3. When applied to the mouse brain, ChRs require ~1–15 mW light delivered ~100 μm from the target cell population to reliably activate action potentials4–6. This confines light-dependent activation to a small volume of brain tissue [~1 mm3]7. Enabling optogenetics for large brain volumes without the need to implant invasive optical fibers for light delivery would be highly desirable for neuroscience applications.\\n\\nEngineering ChRs to overcome limits in conductance and light sensitivity and extend the reach of optogenetic experiments requires overcoming three major challenges. First, rhodopsins are trans-membrane proteins that are inherently difficult to engineer because the sequence and structural determinants of membrane protein expression and plasma-membrane localization are highly constrained and poorly understood8,9. Second, because properties of interest for neuroscience applications are assayed using low-throughput techniques, such as patch-clamp electrophysiology, engineering by directed evolution is not feasible10. And third, in vivo applications require retention and optimization of multiple properties, for example, localization in mammalian cells while simultaneously tuning kinetics, photocurrents, and spectral properties6.\\n\\nDiverse ChRs have been published, including variants discovered from nature11,12, variants engineered through recombination9,13 and mutagenesis14,15, as well as variants resulting from rational design16. Studies of these coupled with structural information17 and molecular dynamic simulations18 have established some understanding of the mechanics and sequence features important for specific ChR properties1,16. Despite this, it is still not possible to predict functional properties of new ChR sequences.\\n\\nOur approach has been to leverage the significant literature of ChRs to train statistical models that enable design of highly-functional ChRs. These models take as their input the sequence and structural information for a given ChR variant and then predict its functional properties. The models use training data to learn how sequence and structural elements map to ChR function. Once known, that mapping can be used to predict the behavior of untested ChR variants.\\n\\nWe trained models in this manner and found that they accurately predict the properties of untested ChR sequences. We used these models to engineer 30 'designer' ChR variants with specific combinations of desired properties, a number of which have unprecedented photocurrent strength and light sensitivity. We characterized these low-light sensitive, high-photocurrent ChRs for applications in the mammalian brain and demonstrate their potential for minimally-invasive activation of populations of neurons in the brain enabled by systemic transgene delivery with the engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV), rAAV-PHP.eB19.

These recombination libraries are a rich source of functionally diverse sequences9. Previously, we generated 102 ChR variants selected from these recombination libraries8,9, 76 of these were previously characterized for photocurrent properties (with patch-clamp electrophysiology) and 26 we characterized here. Together, these 102 ChR recombination variants provide the primary dataset used for model training. We supplemented this dataset with data from other published sources including 19 ChR variants from nature, 14 single-mutant ChR variants, and 28 recombination variants from other libraries (Dataset 1). As the data produced by other labs were not collected under the same experimental conditions as data collected in our hands, they cannot be used for comparison for absolute ChR properties (i.e. photocurrent strength); however, these data do provide useful binary information on whether a sequence variant is functional or not. Thus, we used published data from other sources when training binary classification models for ChR function.\\n\\nBecause our goal was to optimize photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics, we used these measured properties to train machine-learning models (Figure 1a). Enhancing ChR photocurrent strength would enable reliable neuronal activation even under low-light conditions. Different off-rates can be useful for specific applications: fast off-kinetics enable high-frequency optical stimulation23, slow off-kinetics is correlated with increased light sensitivity3,14,15, and very slow off-kinetics can be used for constant depolarization (step-function opsins [SFOs]14). In addition to opsin functional properties, it is also necessary to optimize or maintain plasma-membrane localization, a prerequisite for ChR function8.\\n\\n## Training Gaussian process (GP) classification and regression models\\n\\nUsing the ChR sequence/structure and functional data as inputs, we trained Gaussian process (GP) classification and regression models (Figure 1). GP models successfully predicted thermostability, substrate binding affinity, and kinetics for several soluble enzymes24, and, more recently, ChR membrane localization8. For a detailed description of the GP model architecture used for protein engineering see refs 8, 24. Briefly, these models infer predictive values for new sequences from training examples by assuming that similar inputs (ChR sequence variants) will have similar outputs (photocurrent properties). To quantify the relatedness of inputs (ChR sequence variants), we compared both sequence and structure. ChR sequence information is encoded in the amino acid sequence. For structural comparisons, we convert the 3D crystal-structural information into a 'contact map' that is convenient for modeling. Two residues are considered to be in contact and potentially important for structural and functional integrity if they have any non-hydrogen atoms within 4.5 Å in the C1C2 crystal structure (3UG9.pdb)17. We defined the sequence and structural\\n\\nNat Methods.

We then used this trained classification model to predict whether uncharacterized ChR sequence variants were functional (Figure 1b). To test prediction accuracy, we performed 20-fold cross validation on the training data set and achieved an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.78, indicating good predictive power (Supplemental Table 1).\\n\\nNext, we trained three regression models, one for each of the ChR photocurrent properties of interest: photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity of photocurrents, and off-kinetics (Figure 1c). Once trained, these models were used to predict photocurrent properties of new, untested ChRs sequence variants. To test prediction accuracy, we performed 20-fold cross validation on the training dataset and observed high correlation between predicted and measured properties for all models (Pearson correlation [R] between 0.77-0.9; Supplemental Table 1-2). Models built using contact maps from either the ChR2 crystal structure25 or C1Chrimson crystal structure26 perform as well as models built with a contact map from the C1C2 structure17 (Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Figure 1c,d) even though these maps share only 82% and 89% of their contacts with the C1C2 map, respectively (Supplemental Figure 1a,b).\\n\\n## Selection of designer ChRs using trained models\\n\\nTo select 'designer' ChRs (i.e. ChRs predicted to have a useful combination of properties), we used a tiered approach (Figure 1d). First, we eliminated all ChR sequences predicted to not localize to the plasma membrane or predicted to be non-functional. To do this, we used classification models of ChR localization8 and function to predict the probability of localization and function for each ChR sequence in the 120,000-variant recombination library. Not surprisingly, most ChR variants were predicted to not localize and not function. To focus on ChR variants predicted to localize and function, we set a threshold for the product of the predicted probabilities of localization and function (Figure 1b); any ChR sequence above that threshold would be considered for the next tier of the process. We selected a conservative threshold of 0.4.\\n\\nThe training data made clear that the higher the mutation distance from one of the three parents, the less likely it was that a sequence would be functional; however, we expect that more diverse sequences would also have the more diverse functional properties. To explore diverse sequences predicted to function, we selected 22 ChR variants that passed the 0.4 threshold and were multi-block-swap sequences containing on average 70 mutations from the closest parent. These 22 sequences were synthesized, expressed in HEK cells, and their photocurrent properties were measured with patch-clamp electrophysiology. 59% of the tested sequences were functional (Figure 1e), compared to 38% of the multi-block swap sequences randomly selected (i.e., not selected by the model) and having comparable average mutation level. This validates the classification model's ability to make useful predictions about novel functional sequences, even for sequences that are very distant from the parents.\\n\\nNat Methods.

We updated the models by including data from these 22 sequences for future rounds of predictions.\\n\\nFrom the 120,000-variant recombination library, 1,161 chimeric sequence variants passed the conservative 0.4 predicted localization and function threshold (Figure 1). For the second tier of the selection process, we used the three regression models trained on all functional variants collected up to this point to predict the photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity of photocurrents, and off-kinetics for each of these 1,161 ChR sequence variants (Dataset 3). We selected 28 designer ChRs predicted to be highly functional with different combinations of properties including those predicted to have the highest photocurrent strength, most red-shifted or blue-shifted activation wavelengths, and off-kinetics from very fast to very slow (Supplemental Figure 2–3).\\n\\nGenes encoding the 28 selected designer ChR variants were synthesized, expressed in HEK cells, and characterized for their photocurrent properties with patch-clamp electrophysiology. All 28 selected designer ChRs were functional: 100% of variants selected using the updated classification model above the 0.4 threshold both localize and function. For each of the designer ChR variants, the measured photocurrent properties correlated well with the model predictions (R>0.9 for all models) (Figure 1f, Supplemental Table 1). This outstanding performance on a novel set of sequences demonstrates the power of this data-driven predictive method for engineering designer ChRs. As a negative control, we selected two ChR variant sequences from the recombination library that the model predicted would be non-functional (ChR_29_10 and ChR_30_10). These sequences resulted from a single-block swap from two of the most highly functional ChR recombination variants tested. As predicted, these sequences were non-functional (Figure 2b), which shows that ChR functionality can be attenuated by incorporating even minimal diversity at certain positions.\\n\\n## Sequence and structural determinants of ChR functional properties\\n\\nWe used L1-regularized linear regression models to identify a limited set of residues and structural contacts that strongly influence ChR photocurrent strength, spectral properties, and off-kinetics (Supplemental Figure 4a). We can assess the relative importance of each of these sequence and structural features by weighting their contributions using L2-regularized linear regression (Dataset 4 and Supplemental Figure 4). For each functional property, we identified a set of important residues and contacts and their respective weights. A specific residue or contact at a given position is weighted as likely to lead to, e.g., low (negative weight) or high (positive weight) photocurrents. A number of residues and contacts most important for tuning spectral properties are proximal to the retinal-binding pocket, including the blue-shifting contact between A206 and F269 and the blue-shifting contact between F265 and I267 that are conserved in the blue-shifted parents C1C2 and CheRiff while the red-shifting contact between F201 and Y217 originates from the red-shifted CsChrimR parent (Supplemental Figure 4). The most heavily weighted contact contributing to off-kinetics includes the reside D195 (i.e., D156 according to ChR2 numbering) (Supplemental Figure 4), a residue that is part of the DC-gate¹. Mutation of either the aspartic acid or cysteine within the DC-gate has been shown to decrease off-kinetic speed¹⁴,²⁷. While the cysteine in the DC-gate is conserved in all three ChR parents, the aspartic acid at position\\n\\nNat Methods.

Interestingly, D195 is also part of a contact with L192 that contributes strongly to photocurrent strength (Supplemental Figure 4). A number of contacts proximal to retinal contribute strongly to photocurrent strength. For example, the most heavily weighted contact includes A295 (from CsChrimR), which is adjacent to the conserved lysine residue that covalently links retinal (Supplemental Figure 4). This position is a serine in both C1C2 and CheRiff.\\n\\n## Machine-guided search identifies ChRs with a range of useful functional properties\\n\\nWe assessed photocurrent amplitude, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics of the designer ChRs and the three parental ChRs (Figure 2). In addition to the 28 regression model-predicted ChRs, we also assessed the two top-performing ChRs from the classification models' predictions (ChR_9_4 and ChR_25_9), for a total of 30 highly-functional model-predicted ChRs as well as the two negative control ChRs (ChR_29_10, ChR_30_10). Of the 30 model-predicted ChRs, we found 12 variants with ≥2-times higher blue-light activated photocurrents than the top-performing parent (CsChrimR) (Figure 2b). Three variants exhibit ≥1.7-times higher green-light activated photocurrents than CsChrimR. Eight variants have larger red-light activated photocurrents when compared with the blue-light activated parents (CheRiff and C1C2), though none out-perform CsChrimR. Both ChR variants predicted to be non-functional by the models produce <30 pA currents.\\n\\nDesigner ChRs' off-kinetics span three orders of magnitude (τoff = 10 ms – >10 s) (Figure 2c). This range is quite remarkable given that all designer ChRs are built from sequence blocks of three parents that have similar off-kinetics (τoff = 30–50 ms). We found that 5 designer ChRs have faster off-kinetics than the fastest parent, while 16 have >5-times slower off-kinetics. The two fastest variants, ChR_3_10 and ChR_21_10 exhibit τoff = 13±0.9 ms and 12±0.4 ms, respectively (mean±SEM). Four ChRs have particularly slow off-kinetics with τoff > 1 s, including ChR_15_10, ChR_6_10, and ChR_13_10 (τoff = 4.3±0.1 s, 8.0±0.5 s, and 17±7 s, respectively). Two ChRs with very large photocurrents, ChR_25_9 and ChR_11_10, exhibit τoff = 220±10 ms and 330±30 ms, respectively.\\n\\nThree designer ChRs exhibit interesting spectral properties (Figure 2e, Supplemental Figure 5). ChR_28_10's red-shifted spectrum matches that of CsChrimR, demonstrating that incorporating sequence elements from blue-shifted ChRs into CsChrimR can still generate a red-shifted activation spectrum. Two designer ChRs exhibit novel spectral properties: ChR_11_10 has a broad activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with similar steady-state current strength from 400–546 nm light and strong currents (700 ± 100 pA) when activated with 567 nm light. ChR_25_9, on the other hand, exhibits a narrow activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with a peak at 481 nm light.\\n\\nWe assessed the light sensitivity of select designer ChRs. Compared with CsChrimR, CheRiff, and C1C2, the designer ChRs have ≥9-times larger currents at the lowest intensity of light tested (10^-1 mW mm^-2), larger currents at all intensities of light tested, and minimal decrease in photocurrent magnitude over the range of intensities tested (10^-1–10^1 mW mm^-2), suggesting that photocurrents were saturated at these intensities and would only attenuate at much lower light intensities (Figure 2d).

The selected designer ChRs produce 3–6x larger photocurrents than ChR2(H134R) when exposed to high-intensity (2.2 mW mm−2) 481 nm light and 10–18x larger photocurrents than ChR2(H134R) when exposed to low-intensity (6.5×10−2 mW mm−2) 481 nm light (Supplemental Figure 8f,g). Although CoChR produced peak currents of similar magnitude to the designer ChRs, CoChR decays to a much lower steady-state level (Supplemental Figure 8d,e) with the designer ChRs producing 2–3x larger steady-state photocurrents than CoChR when exposed to high-intensity light and 3–4x larger steady-state photocurrents than CoChR when exposed to low-intensity light (Supplemental Figure 8f,g; Supplemental Table 4). The increased low-light sensitivity of these select designer ChRs is likely due in part to their relatively slow off-kinetics leading to the increased accumulation of the open state under low-light conditions14.\\n\\n## Validation of designer ChRs for neuroscience applications\\n\\nFor further validation we selected three of the top high-conductance ChRs, ChR_9_4, ChR_25_9, and ChR_11_10, and renamed them ChRger1, ChRger2, and ChRger3, respectively, for channelrhodopsin Gaussian process-engineered recombinant opsin (Supplemental Figure 9). When expressed in cultured neurons, the ChRgers display robust membrane localization and expression throughout the neuron soma and neurites (Figure 3b). The ChRgers outperform both CoChR and ChR2(H134R) in photocurrent strength with low-intensity light in neuronal cultures (Figure 3c). The designer ChRgers require 1–2 orders of magnitude lower light intensity than CoChR and ChR2(H134R) for neuronal activation (Figure 3d, Supplemental Figure 8h).\\n\\nNext, we performed direct intracranial injections into the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChRger1–3, or ChR2(H134R) under the hSyn promoter (Supplemental Table 5). After 3–5 weeks of expression, we measured light sensitivity in ChR-expressing neurons in acute brain slices. We observed greater light sensitivity for the ChRgers compared with ChR2(H134R) (Figure 3g,h). The ChRgers exhibit >200 pA photocurrent at 10−3 mW mm−2 while at the equivalent irradiance ChR2(H134R) exhibits undetectable photocurrents. The ChRgers reach >1000 pA photocurrents with ~10−2 mW mm−2 light, a four-fold improvement over ChR2(H134R)'s irradiance-matched photocurrents (Figure 3g). Our characterization of ChR2(H134R)'s light sensitivity and photocurrent strength is consistent with previous results from other labs6,22.\\n\\n## Designer ChRs and systemic AAVs enable minimally-invasive optogenetic excitation\\n\\nWe investigated whether these light-sensitive, high-photocurrent ChRs could provide optogenetic activation coupled with minimally-invasive gene delivery.

Recently, we described the AAV capsid rAAV-PHP.eB19 that produces broad transduction throughout the central nervous system with a single minimally-invasive intravenous injection in the adult mouse30,31. Systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB results in brain-wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections19,30,31. Use of rAAV-PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited, however, by the low multiplicity of infection with systemically delivered viral vectors resulting in insufficient opsin expression and light-evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly-used channels (e.g. ChR2).\\n\\nWe hypothesized that the ChRgers could overcome this limitation and allow large-volume optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery. We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChRger1, ChRger2, CoChR, or ChR2(H134R) under the hSyn promoter and observed broad expression throughout the brain (Figure 3i). We measured the fraction of opsin-expressing cells with sufficient opsin-mediated currents for light-induced firing (Figure 3j). Only 4% of ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons produced light-induced firing, while 77% of CoChR-expressing neurons, 89% of ChRger1-expressing neurons, and 100% of ChRger2- or ChRger3-expressing neurons produced light-induced activity. With systemic delivery, we observed superior light sensitivity of ChRgers compared with CoChR in both photocurrent strength (Figure 3k) and spike fidelity (Figure 3l). ChRger2-expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons both in culture and in slice (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 6). These results demonstrate the need for light-sensitive and high-photocurrent opsins for applications where systemic delivery is desired.\\n\\nWe systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging ChRger1–3 under the CaMKIIa promoter. With systemic delivery of ChRger2, we observed photocurrent strength similar to results observed after direct injection into the PFC (Figure 3g). When expressed in pyramidal neurons in the cortex, ChRger2 and ChRger3 enabled robust optically-induced firing at rates between 2–10 Hz, although spike fidelity was reduced at higher frequency stimulation (Figure 3m,n). ChRger2 performed best with higher frequency stimulation while ChRger1 performed worst. CoChR has better spike fidelity than the ChRgers at higher frequency stimulation (20–40 Hz) (Figure 3m).\\n\\nWe next evaluated the optogenetic efficiency of ChRger2 after systemic delivery using optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation (oICSS) of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA)32. We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging a double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) containing either ChRger2 or ChR2(H134R) into DAT-Cre mice (Figure 4a and Supplemental Table 5). Three weeks after systemic delivery and stereotaxic implantation of fiber-optic cannulas above the VTA, mice were placed in an operant box and were conditioned to trigger a burst of 447 nm laser stimulation via nose poke. Animals expressing ChRger2 displayed robust optogenetic self-stimulation in a frequency-dependent and laser power-dependent manner. Higher frequencies (up to 20 Hz) and higher light power (up to 10 mW) promoted greater maximum operant response rates (Figure 4a). Conversely, laser stimulation failed to reinforce operant responding in ChR2(H134R)-expressing animals (Figure 4a); these results were consistent with results in\\n\\nNat Methods.

In this assay, unilateral stimulation of M2 disrupts motor function in the contralateral lower extremities, causing mice to turn away from the stimulation side. We systemically administered rAAV-PHPeB packaging either ChRger2 or ChR2(H134R) under a CaMKIIa promoter for transgene expression in excitatory pyramidal neurons in the cortex (Figure 4b, and Supplemental Table 5). We observed broad expression throughout the cortex for both ChRger2 and ChR2(H134R) injected animals (Supplemental Figure 11). We secured a fiber-optic cannula guide to the surface of the thinned skull above M2 without puncturing the dura and therefore leaving the brain intact (Figure 4b), which we consider to be minimally invasive. Despite the presence of the highly optically scattering calavarial bone, stimulation with 20 mW 447 nm light induced left-turning behavior in animals expressing ChRger2 but not in animals expressing ChR2(H134R) (Figure 4b and Supplemental Video 1–2). Left-turning behavior terminated upon conclusion of optical stimulation (Supplemental Video 1). Behavioral effects were seen at powers as low as 10 mW. To ensure that the turning behavior was not due to visual stimuli or heating caused by the stimulation laser, we repeated treadmill experiments using 671 nm light, which is outside the excitation spectrum of both opsins. 20 mW 671 nm light failed to induce turning in both ChRger2 and ChR2(H124R). Overall, these experiments demonstrate that ChRger2 is compatible with minimally-invasive systemic gene delivery and can enable minimally-invasive optogenetic excitation. Coupling ChRgers with recently reported upconversion nanoparticles may allow for non-invasive optogenetics in deep brain areas with systemic transgene delivery and tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light for neuronal excitation29.\\n\\n# Discussion\\n\\nWe demonstrated a data-driven approach to engineering ChR properties that enables efficient discovery of highly functional ChR variants based on data from relatively few variants. In this approach we approximate the ChR fitness landscape for a set of ~120,000 chimeric ChRs and use it to efficiently search sequence space and select top-performing variants for a given property10,24,34. By first eliminating the vast majority of non-functional sequences, we can focus on local peaks scattered throughout the landscape. Then, using regression models, we predict which sequences lie on the fitness peaks.\\n\\nMachine learning provides a platform for simultaneous optimization of multiple ChR properties that follow engineering specifications. We were able to generate variants with large variations in off-kinetics (10 ms to >10 s) and photocurrents that far exceed any of the parental or other commonly used ChRs. We also use the machine-learning models to identify the residues and contacts most important for ChR function. Application of this machine-learning pipeline (limited data collection from diverse sequences, model training and validation, and prediction and testing of new sequences) has great potential to optimize other\\n\\nNat Methods.

The high-photocurrent properties of these ChRs overcome the limitation of low per-cell copy number after systemic delivery.

The 10-block contiguous and 10-block noncontiguous recombination libraries were designed and built using SCHEMA recombination9. Software packages for calculating SCHEMA energies are openly available at cheme.che.caltech.edu/groups/fha/Software.htm. Each chimeric ChR variant in these libraries is composed of blocks of sequence from the parental ChR (CsChrimR11, C1C217, and CheRiff22), including chimeras with single-block swaps (chimeras consisting of 9 blocks of one parent and a single block from one of the other two parents) and multi-block-swap chimera sequences.\\n\\nSelected ChR variant genes were inserted into a constant vector backbone [pFCK from Addgene plasmid #51693] with a CMV promoter, Golgi export trafficking signal (TS) sequence (KSRITSEGEYIPLDQIDINV)5, and fluorescent protein (mKate). All ChR variants contain the SpyTag sequence following the N-terminal signal peptide for the SpyTag/SpyCatcher labeling assays used to characterize ChR membrane localization9,36. The C1C2 parent for the recombination libraries is mammalian codon-optimized. ChR variant sequences used in this study are documented in Dataset 2. All selected ChR genes were synthesized and cloned in the pFCK mammalian expression vector by Twist Bioscience. For visualization, sequence alignment between C1C2 and designer ChRs were created using ClustalQ and visualized using ENDscript37 (Supplemental Figure 1c,d).\\n\\nFor characterization in neurons, selected ChR variants [ChRger1, ChRger2, ChRger3, CoChR11, and hChR2(H134R)] were inserted into a pAAV-hSyn vector backbone [Addgene plasmid #26973], a pAAV-CamKIIa vector backbone [Addgene plasmid #51087], and a pAAV-CAG-DIO vector backbone [Addgene plasmid #104052]. In all backbones, each ChR was inserted with a TS sequence5 and fluorescent protein (eYFP).\\n\\n## HEK293T cell and primary neuronal cultures\\n\\nThe culturing and characterization ChRs in HEK cells is described in Bedbrook et al9,36. Briefly, HEK cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in D10 [DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 1% sodium bicarbonate, and 1% sodium pyruvate]. HEK cells were transfected with purified ChR variant DNA using FuGENE®6 reagent according to the manufacturer's (Promega) recommendations.

Light pulse duration, wavelength, and power were varied depending on the experiment (as described in the text). Light pulses were generated using a Lumencor SPECTRAX light engine. The illumination/output spectra for each color were measured (Supplemental Figure 5). To evaluate normalized green photocurrent, we measured photocurrent strength at three wavelengths (peak ± half width at half maximum): (red) 640 ± 3 nm, (green) 546 ± 16 nm, and (cyan) 481 ± 3 nm with a 0.5 s light pulse. Light intensity was matched for these measurements, with 481 nm light at 2.3 mW mm⁻², 546 nm light at 2.8 mW mm⁻², and 640 nm light at 2.2 mW mm⁻². For full spectra measurements depicted in Figure 2e, we measured photocurrents at seven different wavelengths (peak ± half width half maximum): (red) 640 ± 3 nm, (yellow) 567 ± 13 nm, (green) 546 ± 16 nm, (teal) 523 ± 6 nm, (cyan) 481 ± 3 nm LED, (blue) 439 ± 8 nm LED, and (violet) 397 ± 3 nm with a 0.5 s light pulse for each color. Light intensity is matched across wavelengths at 1.3 mW mm⁻².\\n\\nImaging of ChR variants expression in HEK cells was performed using an Andor Neo 5.5 sCMOS camera and Micro-Manager Open Source Microscopy Software. Imaging of ChR expression in neuronal cultures and in brain slices was performed using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope and Zen software.\\n\\n# Electrophysiology data analysis\\n\\nElectrophysiology data were analyzed using Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices, LLC) and custom data-processing scripts written using open-source packages in the Python programming language to perform baseline adjustments, find the peak and steady state inward currents, perform monoexponential fits of photocurrent decay for off-kinetic properties, and quantify spike fidelity. Only neurons with an uncompensated series resistance between 5 and 25 MΩ, Rin > 90 MΩ, and holding current >−150 pA (holding at −60 mV) were included in data analysis (Supplemental Figures 10). The photocurrent amplitude was not adjusted for expression level since both expression and conductance contribute to the in vivo utility of the tool. However, comparisons of expression with photocurrent strength for all ChR variants tested are included in Supplemental Figures 6–7. As metrics of photocurrent strength, peak and steady-state photocurrent were used (Figure 1a). As a metric for the ChR activation spectrum, the normalized current strength induced by exposure to green light (546 nm) was used (Figure 1a). Two parameters were used to characterize ChR off-kinetics: the time to reach 50% of the light-activated current and the photocurrent decay rate, τoff (Figure 1a).\\n\\n# AAV production and purification\\n\\nProduction of recombinant AAV-PHP.eB packaging pAAV-hSyn-X-TS-eYFP-WPRE, pAAV-CAG-DIO[X-TS-eYFP]-WPRE, and pAAV-CaMKIIa-X-TS-eYFP-WPRE (X = ChR2(H134R), CoChR, ChRger1, ChRger2, and ChRger3) was done following the methods described in Deverman et al.⁴² and Challis et al.³¹. Briefly, triple transfection of HEK293T cells (ATCC) was performed using polyethylenimine (PEI). Viral particles were harvested from the media and cells.

Models built using structural encodings built from the ChR2 structure (6EID.pdb) and the C1Chrimson structure (5ZIH.pdb) performed as well as models using the C1C2 structure (Supplemental Figure 1c,d). The models are robust to differences in contact maps because they use both sequence and structural information, which is somewhat redundant.\\n\\nFor a given ChR, the contact map is simply a list of contacting amino acids with their positions. For example, a contact between alanine at position 134 and methionine at position 1 of the amino acid sequence would be encoded by [('A134'), ('M1')]. Both sequence and structural information were one-hot encoded. Regression models for ChR properties were trained to predict the logarithm of the measured properties.

We use Laplace's method to approximate the posterior distribution. Hyperparameters in the kernels are found by maximizing the marginal likelihood. Classification was implemented using open-source packages in the SciPy ecosystem44–46. The binary classification model was trained to predict if a ChR sequence is or is not functional. A ChR sequence was considered to be functional if its photocurrents were >100 pA upon light exposure, a threshold set as an approximate lower bound for current necessary for neuronal activation.\\n\\n## GP kernels for modeling proteins\\nGaussian process regression and classification models require kernel functions that measure the similarity between protein sequences. A protein sequence s of length L is defined by the amino acid present at each location. This can be encoded as a binary feature vector xaa that indicates the presence or absence of each amino acid at each position resulting in a vector of length 20L (for 20 possible amino acids). Likewise, the protein's structure can be represented as a residue-residue contact map. The contact map can be encoded as a binary feature vector xst that indicates the presence or absence of each possible contacting pair. Both the sequence and structure feature vectors were used by concatenating them to form a sequence-structure feature vector.\\n\\nThree types of kernel functions k(s, s') were considered: polynomial kernels, squared exponential kernels, and Matérn kernels. These different forms represent possible functions for the protein's fitness landscape. The polynomial kernel is defined as:\\n\\nk(s, s') = (σ02 + σp2xTx')d  (4)\\n\\nwhere σ0 and σp are hyperparameters. We considered polynomial kernels with d = 3. The squared exponential kernel is defined as:\\n\\nk(s, s') = σp2 exp(-(||x - x'||22) / l)  (5)\\n\\nwhere l and σp are also hyperparameters and ||·||2 is the L2 norm. Finally, the Matérn kernel with ν = 5/2 is defined as:\\n\\nk(s, s') = (1 + √5||x - x'||2 / l + 5||x - x'||22 / 3l2) exp(-√5||x - x'||2 / l)  (6)\\n\\nNat Methods.

First, residues and contacts that covary were identified using the concatenated sequence and structure binary feature vector for each of the training set ChR variants. Each set of covarying residues and contacts was combined into a single feature. L1 linear regression was used to select the features that contribute most to each ChR functional property of interest. The level of regularization was chosen by maximizing the log marginal likelihood of the Gaussian process regression model trained on the features selected at that level of regularization. We then performed Bayesian ridge regression on the selected features using the default settings in scikit-learn47. Residues and contacts with the largest absolute Bayesian ridge linear regression weights were plotted onto the C1C2 structure (Supplemental Figure 4). For feature identification and weighting, models were trained on both the training set and also the test set of 28 ChR sequences predicted to have useful combinations of diverse properties.\\n\\n## Statistical analysis\\n\\nPlotting and statistical analysis were done in Python 2.7 and 3.6 and GraphPad Prism 7.01.

(a) Upon light exposure, ChRs open and reach a peak inward current and then desensitize reaching a lower steady-state current. We use both peak and steady-state current as metrics for photocurrent strength. To evaluate ChR off-kinetics we used the current decay rate (τoff) after a 1 ms light exposure and also the time to reach 50% of the light-exposed current after light removal. As a metric for wavelength sensitivity of activation, we used the normalized photocurrent with green (546 nm) light, which easily differentiates blue-shifted ChRs (peak activation: ~450–480 nm) and red-shifted ChRs (peak activation: ~520–650 nm). (b) We trained classification models to predict whether ChRs would localize correctly to the plasma membrane and function (i.e., ChRs above the 0.4 threshold for the product of the predicted probabilities (pp) of localization and function). (c) We then trained regression models to approximate the fitness landscape for each property of interest for the recombination library (inset show hypothetical fitness landscapes). (b–e) Models were trained with photocurrent properties for each ChR in the training set (plots show 20-fold cross validation on the training set). Sequences predicted to localize and function by the classification models and predicted to have an optimized set of functional properties by the regression models were selected for further characterization,\\n[FIGURE CAPTION END]\\n\\nThe image shows a complex figure with multiple panels labeled from a to f.

      "limitations of available ChRs prohibit a number of optogenetic applications.\n",
      "These channels have broad activation spectra in the visible range and require high-intensity light for activation [~1 mW mm−2].\n",
      "ChRs are naturally low-conductance channels requiring approximately 105–106 functional ChRs expressed in the plasma-membrane of a neuron to produce sufficient light-dependent depolarization to induce neuronal activation3.\n",
      "When applied to the mouse brain, ChRs require ~1–15 mW light delivered ~100 μm from the target cell population to reliably activate action potentials4–6.\n",
      "This confines light-dependent activation to a small volume of brain tissue [~1 mm3]7.\n",
      "Enabling optogenetics for large brain volumes without the need to implant invasive optical fibers for light delivery would be highly desirable for neuroscience applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engineering ChRs to overcome limits in conductance and light sensitivity and extend the reach of optogenetic experiments requires overcoming three major challenges.\n",
      "First, rhodopsins are trans-membrane proteins that are inherently difficult to engineer because the sequence and structural determinants of membrane protein expression and plasma- membrane localization are highly constrained and poorly understood8,9.\n",
      "Second, because properties of interest for neuroscience applications are assayed using low-throughput techniques, such as patch-clamp electrophysiology, engineering by directed evolution is not feasible10.\n",
      "And third, in vivo applications require retention and optimization of multiple properties, for example, localization in mammalian cells while simultaneously tuning kinetics, photocurrents, and spectral properties6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diverse ChRs have been published, including variants discovered from nature11,12, variants engineered through recombination9,13 and mutagenesis14,15, as well as variants resulting from rational design16.\n",
      "Studies of these coupled with structural information17 and molecular dynamic simulations18 have established some understanding of the mechanics and sequence features important for specific ChR properties1,16.\n",
      "Despite this, it is still not possible to predict functional properties of new ChR sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our approach has been to leverage the significant literature of ChRs to train statistical models that enable design of highly-functional ChRs.\n",
      "These models take as their input the sequence and structural information for a given ChR variant and then predict its functional properties.\n",
      "The models use training data to learn how sequence and structural elements map to ChR function.\n",
      "Once known, that mapping can be used to predict the behavior of untested ChR variants.\n",
      "\n",
      "We trained models in this manner and found that they accurately predict the properties of untested ChR sequences.\n",
      "We used these models to engineer 30 ‘designer’ ChR variants with specific combinations of desired properties, a number of which have unprecedented photocurrent strength and light sensitivity.\n",
      "We characterized these low-light sensitive, high- photocurrent ChRs for applications in the mammalian brain and demonstrate their potential for minimally-invasive activation of populations of neurons in the brain enabled by systemic transgene delivery with the engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV), rAAV-PHP.eB19.\n",
      "This work demonstrates how a machine learning-guided approach can enable engineering of proteins that have been challenging to engineer.\n",

      "## Results\n",
      "\n",
      "### Functional characterization of ChR variants for machine learning\n",
      "\n",
      "In previous work, we explored structure-guided recombination20,21 of three highly- functional ChR parents [CsChrimsonR (CsChrimR)11, C1C217, and CheRiff22] by designing two 10-block recombination libraries with a theoretical size of ~120,000 (i.e. 2×310) chimeric variants9.\n",
      "These recombination libraries are a rich source of functionally diverse sequences9.\n",
      "Previously, we generated 102 ChR variants selected from these recombination libraries8,9, 76 of these were previously characterized for photocurrent properties (with patch-clamp electrophysiology) and 26 we characterized here.\n",
      "Together, these 102 ChR recombination variants provide the primary dataset used for model training.\n",
      "We supplemented this dataset with data from other published sources including 19 ChR variants from nature, 14 single-mutant ChR variants, and 28 recombination variants from other libraries (Dataset 1).\n",
      "As the data produced by other labs were not collected under the same experimental conditions as data collected in our hands, they cannot be used for comparison for absolute ChR properties (i.e. photocurrent strength); however, these data do provide useful binary information on whether a sequence variant is functional or not.\n",
      "Thus, we used published data from other sources when training binary classification models for ChR function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because our goal was to optimize photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity, and off- kinetics, we used these measured properties to train machine-learning models (Figure 1a).\n",
      "Enhancing ChR photocurrent strength would enable reliable neuronal activation even under low-light conditions.\n",
      "Different off-rates can be useful for specific applications: fast off- kinetics enable high-frequency optical stimulation23, slow off-kinetics is correlated with increased light sensitivity3,14,15, and very slow off-kinetics can be used for constant depolarization (step-function opsins [SFOs]14).\n",
      "In addition to opsin functional properties, it is also necessary to optimize or maintain plasma-membrane localization, a prerequisite for ChR function8.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Training Gaussian process (GP) classification and regression models\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the ChR sequence/structure and functional data as inputs, we trained Gaussian process (GP) classification and regression models (Figure 1).\n",
      "GP models successfully predicted thermostability, substrate binding affinity, and kinetics for several soluble enzymes24, and, more recently, ChR membrane localization8.\n",
      "For a detailed description of the GP model architecture used for protein engineering see refs 8, 24.\n",
      "Briefly, these models infer predictive values for new sequences from training examples by assuming that similar inputs (ChR sequence variants) will have similar outputs (photocurrent properties).\n",
      "To quantify the relatedness of inputs (ChR sequence variants), we compared both sequence and structure.\n",
      "ChR sequence information is encoded in the amino acid sequence.\n",
      "For structural comparisons, we convert the 3D crystal-structural information into a ‘contact map’ that is convenient for modeling.\n",
      "Two residues are considered to be in contact and potentially important for structural and functional integrity if they have any non-hydrogen atoms within\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4.5 Å in the C1C2 crystal structure (3UG9\n",
      "\n",
      "We defined the sequence and structural similarity between two variants by aligning them and counting the number of positions and contacts at which they are identical24.\n",
      "\n",
      "We trained a binary classification model to predict if a ChR sequence will be functional using all 102 training sequences from the recombination library (Dataset 2) as well as data from 61 variants published by others (Dataset 1).\n",
      "We then used this trained classification model to predict whether uncharacterized ChR sequence variants were functional (Figure 1b).\n",
      "To test prediction accuracy, we performed 20-fold cross validation on the training data set and achieved an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.78, indicating good predictive power (Supplemental Table 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we trained three regression models, one for each of the ChR photocurrent properties of interest: photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity of photocurrents, and off-kinetics (Figure 1c).\n",
      "Once trained, these models were used to predict photocurrent properties of new, untested ChRs sequence variants.\n",
      "To test prediction accuracy, we performed 20-fold cross validation on the training dataset and observed high correlation between predicted and measured properties for all models (Pearson correlation [R] between 0.77–0.9; Supplemental Table 1–2).\n",
      "Models built using contact maps from either the ChR2 crystal structure25 or C1Chrimson crystal structure26 perform as well as models built with a contact map from the C1C2 structure17 (Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Figure 1c,d) even though these maps share only 82% and 89% of their contacts with the C1C2 map, respectively (Supplemental Figure 1a,b).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Selection of designer ChRs using trained models\n",
      "\n",
      "To select ‘designer’ ChRs (i.e. ChRs predicted to have a useful combination of properties), we used a tiered approach (Figure 1d).\n",
      "First, we eliminated all ChR sequences predicted to not localize to the plasma membrane or predicted to be non-functional.\n",
      "To do this, we used classification models of ChR localization8 and function to predict the probability of localization and function for each ChR sequence in the 120,000-variant recombination library.\n",
      "Not surprisingly, most ChR variants were predicted to not localize and not function.\n",
      "To focus on ChR variants predicted to localize and function, we set a threshold for the product of the predicted probabilities of localization and function (Figure 1b); any ChR sequence above that threshold would be considered for the next tier of the process.\n",
      "We selected a conservative threshold of 0.4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The training data made clear that the higher the mutation distance from one of the three parents, the less likely it was that a sequence would be functional; however, we expect that more diverse sequences would also have the more diverse functional properties.\n",
      "To explore diverse sequences predicted to function, we selected 22 ChR variants that passed the 0.4 threshold and were multi-block-swap sequences containing on average 70 mutations from the closest parent.\n",
      "These 22 sequences were synthesized, expressed in HEK cells, and their photocurrent properties were measured with patch-clamp electrophysiology.\n",
      "59% of the tested sequences were functional (Figure 1e), compared to 38% of the multi-block swap sequences randomly selected (i.e., not selected by the model) and having comparable average mutation level.\n",
      "This validates the classification model’s ability to make useful predictions about novel functional sequences, even for sequences that are very distant from those previously tested.\n",
      "We updated the models by including data from these 22 sequences for future rounds of predictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the 120,000-variant recombination library, 1,161 chimeric sequence variants passed the conservative 0.4 predicted localization and function threshold (Figure 1).\n",
      "For the second tier of the selection process, we used the three regression models trained on all functional variants collected up to this point to predict the photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity of photocurrents, and off-kinetics for each of these 1,161 ChR sequence variants (Dataset 3).\n",
      "We selected 28 designer ChRs predicted to be highly functional with different combinations of properties including those predicted to have the highest photocurrent strength, most red- shifted or blue-shifted activation wavelengths, and off-kinetics from very fast to very slow (Supplemental Figure 2–3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Genes encoding the 28 selected designer ChR variants were synthesized, expressed in HEK cells, and characterized for their photocurrent properties with patch-clamp electrophysiology.\n",
      "All 28 selected designer ChRs were functional: 100% of variants selected using the updated classification model above the 0.4 threshold both localize and function.\n",
      "For each of the designer ChR variants, the measured photocurrent properties correlated well with the model predictions (R>0.9 for all models) (Figure 1f, Supplemental Table 1).\n",
      "This outstanding performance on a novel set of sequences demonstrates the power of this data- driven predictive method for engineering designer ChRs.\n",
      "As a negative control, we selected two ChR variant sequences from the recombination library that the model predicted would be non-functional (ChR_29_10 and ChR_30_10).\n",
      "These sequences resulted from a single- block swap from two of the most highly functional ChR recombination variants tested.\n",
      "As predicted, these sequences were non-functional (Figure 2b), which shows that ChR functionality can be attenuated by incorporating even minimal diversity at certain positions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Sequence and structural determinants of ChR functional properties\n",
      "\n",
      "We used L1-regularized linear regression models to identify a limited set of residues and structural contacts that strongly influence ChR photocurrent strength, spectral properties, and off-kinetics (Supplemental Figure 4a).\n",
      "We can assess the relative importance of each of these sequence and structural features by weighting their contributions using L2-regularized linear regression (Dataset 4 and Supplemental Figure 4).\n",
      "For each functional property, we identified a set of important residues and contacts and their respective weights.\n",
      "A specific residue or contact at a given position is weighted as likely to lead to, e.g., low (negative weight) or high (positive weight) photocurrents.\n",
      "A number of residues and contacts most important for tuning spectral properties are proximal to the retinal-binding pocket, including the blue-shifting contact between A206 and F269 and the blue-shifting contact between F265 and I267 that are conserved in the blue-shifted parents C1C2 and CheRiff while the red-shifting contact between F201 and Y217 originates from the red-shifted CsChrimR parent (Supplemental Figure 4).\n",
      "The most heavily weighted contact contributing to off- kinetics includes the reside D195 (i.e., D156 according to ChR2 numbering) (Supplemental Figure 4), a residue that is part of the DC-gate1.\n",
      "Mutation of either the aspartic acid or cysteine within the DC-gate has been shown to decrease off-kinetic speed14,27.\n",
      "While the cysteine in the DC-gate is conserved in all three ChR parents, the aspartic acid at position 195 is only conserved in CheRiff and C1C2 but not in CsChrimR, which has a cysteine at that position.\n",
      "Interestingly, D195 is also part of a contact with L192 that contributes strongly to photocurrent strength (Supplemental Figure 4).\n",
      "A number of contacts proximal to retinal contribute strongly to photocurrent strength.\n",
      "For example, the most heavily weighted contact includes A295 (from CsChrimR), which is adjacent to the conserved lysine residue that covalently links retinal (Supplemental Figure 4).\n",
      "This position is a serine in both C1C2 and CheRiff.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Machine-guided search identifies ChRs with a range of useful functional properties\n",
      "\n",
      "We assessed photocurrent amplitude, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics of the designer ChRs and the three parental ChRs (Figure 2).\n",
      "In addition to the 28 regression model- predicted ChRs, we also assessed the two top-performing ChRs from the classification models’ predictions (ChR_9_4 and ChR_25_9), for a total of 30 highly-functional model- predicted ChRs as well as the two negative control ChRs (ChR_29_10, ChR_30_10).\n",
      "Of the 30 model-predicted ChRs, we found 12 variants with ≥2-times higher blue-light activated photocurrents than the top-performing parent (CsChrimR) (Figure 2b).\n",
      "Three variants exhibit ≥1.7-times higher green-light activated photocurrents than CsChrimR.\n",
      "Eight variants have larger red-light activated photocurrents when compared with the blue-light activated parents (CheRiff and C1C2), though none out-perform CsChrimR.\n",
      "Both ChR variants predicted to be non-functional by the models produce <30 pA currents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Designer ChRs’ off-kinetics span three orders of magnitude (τoff = 10 ms – >10 s) (Figure 2c).\n",
      "This range is quite remarkable given that all designer ChRs are built from sequence blocks of three parents that have similar off-kinetics (τoff = 30–50 ms).\n",
      "We found that 5 designer ChRs have faster off-kinetics than the fastest parent, while 16 have >5-times slower off-kinetics.\n",
      "The two fastest variants, ChR_3_10 and ChR_21_10 exhibit τoff = 13±0.9 ms and 12±0.4 ms, respectively (mean±SEM).\n",
      "Four ChRs have particularly slow off-kinetics with τoff > 1 s, including ChR_15_10, ChR_6_10, and ChR_13_10 (τoff = 4.3±0.1 s, 8.0±0.5 s, and 17±7 s, respectively).\n",
      "Two ChRs with very large photocurrents, ChR_25_9 and ChR_11_10, exhibit τoff = 220±10 ms and 330±30 ms, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three designer ChRs exhibit interesting spectral properties (Figure 2e, Supplemental Figure 5).\n",
      "ChR_28_10’s red-shifted spectrum matches that of CsChrimR, demonstrating that incorporating sequence elements from blue-shifted ChRs into CsChrimR can still generate a red-shifted activation spectrum.\n",
      "Two designer ChRs exhibit novel spectral properties: ChR_11_10 has a broad activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with similar steady-state current strength from 400–546 nm light and strong currents (700 ± 100 pA) when activated with 567 nm light.\n",
      "ChR_25_9, on the other hand, exhibits a narrow activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with a peak at 481 nm light.\n",
      "\n",
      "We assessed the light sensitivity of select designer ChRs.\n",
      "Compared with CsChrimR, CheRiff, and C1C2, the designer ChRs have ≥9-times larger currents at the lowest intensity of light tested (10−1 mW mm−2), larger currents at all intensities of light tested, and minimal decrease in photocurrent magnitude over the range of intensities tested (10−1–101 mW mm −2), suggesting that photocurrents were saturated at these intensities and would only attenuate at much lower light intensities (Figure 2d).\n",
      "These select designer ChRs are expressed at levels similar to the CsChrimR parent (the highest expressing parent) indicating that the improved photocurrent strength of these ChRs is not solely due to improved expression (Supplemental Figure 6–7).\n",
      "\n",
      "We compared three of the top designer ChRs (ChR_9_4, ChR_25_9, and ChR_11_10) with ChR2(H134R)6,28, an enhanced photocurrent single mutant of ChR2 commonly used for in vivo optogenetics, and CoChR (from Chloromonas oogama)11, reported to be one of the highest conducting ChRs activated by blue light11.\n",
      "The selected designer ChRs produce 3– 6x larger photocurrents than ChR2(H134R) when exposed to high-intensity (2.2 mW mm−2) 481 nm light and 10–18x larger photocurrents than ChR2(H134R) when exposed to low- intensity (6.5×10−2 mW mm−2) 481 nm light (Supplemental Figure 8f,g).\n",
      "Although CoChR produced peak currents of similar magnitude to the designer ChRs, CoChR decays to a much lower steady-state level (Supplemental Figure 8d,e) with the designer ChRs producing 2–3x larger steady-state photocurrents than CoChR when exposed to high-intensity light and 3–4x larger steady-state photocurrents than CoChR when exposed to low-intensity light (Supplemental Figure 8f,g; Supplemental Table 4).\n",
      "The increased low-light sensitivity of these select designer ChRs is likely due in part to their relatively slow off-kinetics leading to the increased accumulation of the open state under low-light conditions14.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Validation of designer ChRs for neuroscience applications\n",
      "\n",
      "For further validation we selected three of the top high-conductance ChRs, ChR_9_4, ChR_25_9, and ChR_11_10, and renamed them ChRger1, ChRger2, and ChRger3, respectively, for channelrhodopsin Gaussian process-engineered recombinant opsin (Supplemental Figure 9).\n",
      "When expressed in cultured neurons, the ChRgers display robust membrane localization and expression throughout the neuron soma and neurites (Figure 3b).\n",
      "The ChRgers outperform both CoChR and ChR2(H134R) in photocurrent strength with low- intensity light in neuronal cultures (Figure 3c).\n",
      "The designer ChRgers require 1–2 orders of magnitude lower light intensity than CoChR and ChR2(H134R) for neuronal activation (Figure 3d, Supplemental Figure 8h).\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, we performed direct intracranial injections into the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChRger1–3, or ChR2(H134R) under the hSyn promoter (Supplemental Table 5).\n",
      "After 3–5 weeks of expression, we measured light sensitivity in ChR-expressing neurons in acute brain slices.\n",
      "We observed greater light sensitivity for the ChRgers compared with ChR2(H134R) (Figure 3g,h).\n",
      "The ChRgers exhibit >200 pA photocurrent at 10−3 mW mm−2 while at the equivalent irradiance ChR2(H134R) exhibits undetectable photocurrents.\n",
      "The ChRgers reach >1000 pA photocurrents with ~10−2 mW mm−2 light, a four-fold improvement over ChR2(H134R)’s irradiance-matched photocurrents (Figure 3g).\n",
      "Our characterization of ChR2(H134R)’s light sensitivity and photocurrent strength is consistent with previous results from other labs6,22.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Designer ChRs and systemic AAVs enable minimally-invasive optogenetic excitation\n",
      "\n",
      "We investigated whether these light-sensitive, high-photocurrent ChRs could provide optogenetic activation coupled with minimally-invasive gene delivery.\n",
      "Previous reports of ‘non-invasive optogenetics’ relied on invasive intracranial virus delivery, which results in many copies of virus per cell and thus very high expression levels of the injected construct29.\n",
      "Recently, we described the AAV capsid rAAV-PHP.eB19 that produces broad transduction throughout the central nervous system with a single minimally-invasive intravenous injection in the adult mouse30,31.\n",
      "Systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB results in brain-wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections19,30,31.\n",
      "Use of rAAV- PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited, however, by the low multiplicity of infection with systemically delivered viral vectors resulting in insufficient opsin expression and light-evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly-used channels (e.g. ChR2).\n",
      "\n",
      "We hypothesized that the ChRgers could overcome this limitation and allow large-volume optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery.\n",
      "We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChRger1, ChRger2, CoChR, or ChR2(H134R) under the hSyn promoter and observed broad expression throughout the brain (Figure 3i).\n",
      "We measured the fraction of opsin-expressing cells with sufficient opsin-mediated currents for light-induced firing (Figure 3j).\n",
      "Only 4% of ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons produced light-induced firing, while 77% of CoChR-expressing neurons, 89% of ChRger1-expressing neurons, and 100% of ChRger2- or ChRger3-expressing neurons produced light-induced activity.\n",
      "With systemic delivery, we observed superior light sensitivity of ChRgers compared with CoChR in both photocurrent strength (Figure 3k) and spike fidelity (Figure 3l).\n",
      "ChRger2-expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or ChR2(H134R)-expressing neurons both in culture and in slice (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 6).\n",
      "These results demonstrate the need for light-sensitive and high- photocurrent opsins for applications where systemic delivery is desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging ChRger1–3 under the CaMKIIa promoter.\n",
      "With systemic delivery of ChRger2, we observed photocurrent strength similar to results observed after direct injection into the PFC (Figure 3g).\n",
      "When expressed in pyramidal neurons in the cortex, ChRger2 and ChRger3 enabled robust optically-induced firing at rates between 2–10 Hz, although spike fidelity was reduced at higher frequency stimulation (Figure 3m,n).\n",
      "ChRger2 performed best with higher frequency stimulation while ChRger1 performed worst.\n",
      "CoChR has better spike fidelity than the ChRgers at higher frequency stimulation (20–40 Hz) (Figure 3m).\n",
      "\n",
      "We next evaluated the optogenetic efficiency of ChRger2 after systemic delivery using optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation (oICSS) of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA)32.\n",
      "We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging a double- floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) containing either ChRger2 or ChR2(H134R) into Dat-Cre mice (Figure 4a and Supplemental Table 5).\n",
      "Three weeks after systemic delivery and stereotaxic implantation of fiber-optic cannulas above the VTA, mice were placed in an operant box and were conditioned to trigger a burst of 447 nm laser stimulation via nose poke.\n",
      "Animals expressing ChRger2 displayed robust optogenetic self-stimulation in a frequency-dependent and laser power-dependent manner.\n",
      "Higher frequencies (up to 20 Hz) and higher light power (up to 10 mW) promoted greater maximum operant response rates (Figure 4a).\n",
      "Conversely, laser stimulation failed to reinforce operant responding in ChR2(H134R)-expressing animals (Figure 4a); these results were consistent with results in acute slice where the light-induced currents of ChR2(H134R) are too weak at the low copy number produced by systemic delivery for robust neuronal activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to determine if ChRger2 would enable both minimally-invasive transgene delivery and minimally-invasive optical excitation, we assayed directional control of locomotion in freely moving animals by optogenetic stimulation of the right secondary motor cortex (M2)33.\n",
      "In this assay, unilateral stimulation of M2 disrupts motor function in the contralateral lower extremities, causing mice to turn away from the stimulation side.\n",
      "We systemically administered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChRger2 or ChR2(H134R) under a CaMKIIa promoter for transgene expression in excitatory pyramidal neurons in the cortex (Figure 4b, and Supplemental Table 5).\n",
      "We observed broad expression throughout the cortex for both ChRger2 and ChR2(H134R) injected animals (Supplemental Figure 11).\n",
      "We secured a fiber-optic cannula guide to the surface of the thinned skull above M2 without puncturing the dura and therefore leaving the brain intact (Figure 4b), which we consider to be minimally invasive.\n",
      "Despite the presence of the highly optically scattering calavarial bone, stimulation with 20 mW 447 nm light induced left-turning behavior in animals expressing ChRger2 but not in animals expressing ChR2(H134R) (Figure 4b and Supplemental Video 1–2).\n",
      "Left-turning behavior terminated upon conclusion of optical stimulation (Supplemental Video 1).\n",
      "Behavioral effects were seen at powers as low as 10 mW.\n",
      "To ensure that the turning behavior was not due to visual stimuli or heating caused by the stimulation laser, we repeated treadmill experiments using 671 nm light, which is outside the excitation spectrum of both opsins.\n",
      "20 mW 671 nm light failed to induce turning in both ChRger2 and ChR2(H124R).\n",
      "Overall, these experiments demonstrate that ChRger2 is compatible with minimally-invasive systemic gene delivery and can enable minimally- invasive optogenetic excitation.\n",
      "Coupling ChRgers with recently reported upconversion nanoparticles may allow for non-invasive optogenetics in deep brain areas with systemic transgene delivery and tissue-penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light for neuronal excitation29.\n",

      "## Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "We demonstrated a data-driven approach to engineering ChR properties that enables efficient discovery of highly functional ChR variants based on data from relatively few variants.\n",
      "In this approach we approximate the ChR fitness landscape for a set of ~120,000 chimeric ChRs and use it to efficiently search sequence space and select top-performing variants for a given property10,24,34.\n",
      "By first eliminating the vast majority of non-functional sequences, we can focus on local peaks scattered throughout the landscape.\n",
      "Then, using regression models, we predict which sequences lie on the fitness peaks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine learning provides a platform for simultaneous optimization of multiple ChR properties that follow engineering specifications.\n",
      "We were able to generate variants with large variations in off-kinetics (10 ms to >10 s) and photocurrents that far exceed any of the parental or other commonly used ChRs.\n",
      "We also use the machine-learning models to identify the residues and contacts most important for ChR function.\n",
      "Application of this machine- learning pipeline (limited data collection from diverse sequences, model training and validation, and prediction and testing of new sequences) has great potential to optimize other neuroscience tools, e.g., anion-conducting ChRs12, calcium sensors, voltage sensors35, and We designed high-performance ChRs (ChRger1–3) with unprecedented light sensitivity and validated ChRger2’s application for in vivo optogenetics.\n",
      "The high-photocurrent properties of these ChRs overcome the limitation of low per-cell copy number after systemic delivery.\n",
      "ChRger2 enabled neuronal excitation with high temporal precision without invasive intracranial surgery for virus delivery or fiber optic implantation for superficial brain areas, extending what is currently possible for optogenetics experiments.\n",

       "   'suggestedText': \"The following text discusses the limitations of available channelrhodopsins (ChRs) that hinder various optogenetic applications. These channels have broad activation spectra in the visible range and require high-intensity light for activation (approximately 1 mW/mm²). ChRs are naturally low-conductance channels, necessitating the expression of approximately 10^5-10^6 functional ChRs in the plasma membrane of a neuron to produce sufficient light-dependent depolarization to induce neuronal activation. When applied to the mouse brain, ChRs require 1-15 mW light delivered 100 μm from the target cell population to reliably activate action potentials. This confines light-dependent activation to a small volume of brain tissue (approximately 1 mm³). Enabling optogenetics for large brain volumes without the need to implant invasive optical fibers for light delivery would be highly desirable for neuroscience applications.\\n\\nEngineering ChRs to overcome limits in conductance and light sensitivity and extend the reach of optogenetic experiments requires overcoming three major challenges:\\n1. Rhodopsins are transmembrane proteins that are inherently difficult to engineer because the sequence and structural determinants of membrane protein expression and plasma membrane localization are highly constrained and poorly understood.\\n2. Properties of interest for neuroscience applications are assayed using low-throughput techniques, such as patch-clamp electrophysiology, making engineering by directed evolution not feasible.\\n3. In vivo applications require retention and optimization of multiple properties, for example, localization in mammalian cells while simultaneously tuning kinetics, photocurrents, and spectral properties.\\n\\nDiverse ChRs have been published, including variants discovered from nature, variants engineered through recombination and mutagenesis, as well as variants resulting from rational design. Studies of these, coupled with structural information and molecular dynamic simulations, have established some understanding of the mechanics and sequence features important for specific ChR properties. Despite this, it is still not possible to predict the functional properties of new ChR sequences.\\n\\nOur approach has been to leverage the significant literature of ChRs to train statistical models that enable the design of highly functional ChRs. These models take as their input the sequence and structural information for a given ChR variant and then predict its functional properties. The models use training data to learn how sequence and structural elements map to ChR function. Once known, that mapping can be used to predict the behavior of untested ChR variants.\\n\\nWe trained models in this manner and found that they accurately predict the properties of untested ChR sequences. We used these models to engineer 30 'designer' ChR variants with specific combinations of desired properties, a number of which have unprecedented photocurrent strength and light sensitivity. We characterized these low-light sensitive, high-photocurrent ChRs for applications in the mammalian brain and demonstrated their potential for minimally-invasive activation of populations of neurons in the brain enabled by systemic transgene delivery with the engineered adeno-associated virus (AAV), rAAV-PHP.eB. This work demonstrates how a machine learning-guided approach can enable the engineering of proteins that have been challenging to engineer.\\n\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nNat Methods. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 April 14.\\nBedbrook et al.\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nPage 3\\nResults\\nFunctional characterization of ChR variants for machine learning\\nIn previous work, we explored structure-guided recombination of three highly functional channelrhodopsin (ChR) parents: CsChrimsonR (CsChrimR), C1C2, and CheRiff, by designing two 10-block recombination libraries with a theoretical size of approximately 120,000 (i.e., 2 × 3^10) chimeric variants. These recombination libraries are a rich source of functionally diverse sequences. Previously, we generated 102 ChR variants selected from these recombination libraries. Seventy-six of these were previously characterized for photocurrent properties using patch-clamp electrophysiology, and 26 we characterized here. Together, these 102 ChR recombination variants provide the primary dataset used for model training. We supplemented this dataset with data from other published sources, including 19 ChR variants from nature, 14 single-mutant ChR variants, and 28 recombination variants from other libraries (Dataset 1). As the data produced by other labs were not collected under the same experimental conditions as data collected in our hands, they cannot be used for comparison for absolute ChR properties (i.e., photocurrent strength); however, these data do provide useful binary information on whether a sequence variant is functional or not. Thus, we used published data from other sources when training binary classification models for ChR function.\\n\\nBecause our goal was to optimize photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics, we used these measured properties to train machine-learning models (Figure 1a). Enhancing ChR photocurrent strength would enable reliable neuronal activation even under low-light conditions. Different off-rates can be useful for specific applications: fast off-kinetics enable high-frequency optical stimulation, slow off-kinetics is correlated with increased light sensitivity, and very slow off-kinetics can be used for constant depolarization (step-function opsins [SFOs]). In addition to opsin functional properties, it is also necessary to optimize or maintain plasma-membrane localization, a prerequisite for ChR function.\\n\\nTraining Gaussian process (GP) classification and regression models...\",\n",

These models take as their input the\\n sequence and structural information for a given ChR variant and then predict its functional\\n properties . The models use training data to learn how sequence and structural elements map\\n to ChR function . Once known , that mapping can be used to predict the behavior of untested\\n ChR variants .\\nWe trained models in this manner and found that they accurately predict the properties of\\n untested ChR sequences . We used these models to engineer 30 ' designer ' ChR variants with\\n specific combinations of desired properties , a number of which have unprecedented\\n photocurrent strength and light sensitivity . We characterized these low - light sensitive , high-\\n photocurrent ChRs for applications in the mammalian brain and demonstrate their potential\\n for minimally - invasive activation of populations of neurons in the brain enabled by systemic\\n transgene delivery with the engineered adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) , rAAV - PHP.eB 19. This\\n work demonstrates how a machine learning - guided approach can enable engineering of\\n proteins that have been challenging to engineer .\\nAuthor\\n Manuscript\\nAuthor\\n Manuscript\\nAuthor\\n Manuscript\\nAuthor\\n Manuscript\\nNat Methods .

These recombination libraries are a rich source of functionally diverse\\n sequences⁹ . Previously , we generated 102 ChR variants selected from these recombination\\n libraries 8,9 , 76 of these were previously characterized for photocurrent properties ( with\\n patch - clamp electrophysiology ) and 26 we characterized here . Together , these 102 ChR\\n recombination variants provide the primary dataset used for model training . We\\n supplemented this dataset with data from other published sources including 19 ChR variants\\n from nature , 14 single - mutant ChR variants , and 28 recombination variants from other\\n libraries ( Dataset 1 ) . As the data produced by other labs were not collected under the same\\n experimental conditions as data collected in our hands , they cannot be used for comparison\\n for absolute ChR properties ( i.e. photocurrent strength ) ; however , these data do provide\\n useful binary information on whether a sequence variant is functional or not . Thus , we used\\n published data from other sources when training binary classification models for ChR\\n function .\\nBecause our goal was to optimize photocurrent strength , wavelength sensitivity , and off-\\n kinetics , we used these measured properties to train machine - learning models ( Figure 1a ) .\\n Enhancing ChR photocurrent strength would enable reliable neuronal activation even under\\n low - light conditions . Different off - rates can be useful for specific applications : fast off-\\n kinetics enable high - frequency optical stimulation 23 , slow off - kinetics is correlated with\\n increased light sensitivity 3,14,15 , and very slow off - kinetics can be used for constant\\n depolarization ( step - function opsins [ SFOS ] 14 ) . In addition to opsin functional properties , it\\n is also necessary to optimize or maintain plasma - membrane localization , a prerequisite for\\n ChR function³ .\\nTraining Gaussian process ( GP ) classification and regression models\"},\n",

For each of the designer ChR variants, the measured photocurrent properties correlated well with the model predictions (R > 0.9 for all models) (Figure 1f, Supplemental Table 1).

The main themes include the engineering of ChRs to achieve higher photocurrent strength and light sensitivity, enabling minimally-invasive neuronal activation. The document describes the use of Gaussian Process models to predict and design new ChR variants, resulting in ChRs that can be delivered systemically and activate neurons effectively under low-light conditions. Key participants include researchers from the California Institute of Technology, such as Claire N. Bedbrook, Kevin K. Yang, J. Elliott Robinson, Elisha D. Mackey, Viviana Gradinaru, and Frances H. Arnold.

       "   'suggestedText': \"The following text excerpt:\\n\\n195 is only conserved in CheRiff and C1C2 but not in CsChrimR, which has a cysteine at that position. Interestingly, D195 is also part of a contact with L192 that contributes strongly to photocurrent strength (Supplemental Figure 4). A number of contacts proximal to retinal contribute strongly to photocurrent strength. For example, the most heavily weighted contact includes A295 (from CsChrimR), which is adjacent to the conserved lysine residue that covalently links retinal (Supplemental Figure 4). This position is a serine in both C1C2 and CheRiff.\\n\\nMachine-guided search identifies ChRs with a range of useful functional properties. We assessed photocurrent amplitude, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics of the designer ChRs and the three parental ChRs (Figure 2). In addition to the 28 regression model-predicted ChRs, we also assessed the two top-performing ChRs from the classification models' predictions (ChR_9_4 and ChR_25_9), for a total of 30 highly-functional model-predicted ChRs as well as the two negative control ChRs (ChR_29_10, ChR_30_10). Of the 30 model-predicted ChRs, we found 12 variants with 2-times higher blue-light activated photocurrents than the top-performing parent (CsChrimR) (Figure 2b). Three variants exhibit 1.7-times higher green-light activated photocurrents than CsChrimR. Eight variants have larger red-light activated photocurrents when compared with the blue-light activated parents (CheRiff and C1C2), though none out-perform CsChrimR. Both ChR variants predicted to be non-functional by the models produce < 30 pA currents.\\n\\nDesigner ChRs' off-kinetics span three orders of magnitude (toff = 10 ms -> 10 s) (Figure 2c). This range is quite remarkable given that all designer ChRs are built from sequence blocks of three parents that have similar off-kinetics (toff = 30-50 ms). We found that 5 designer ChRs have faster off-kinetics than the fastest parent, while 16 have > 5-times slower off-kinetics. The two fastest variants, ChR_3_10 and ChR_21_10, exhibit toff = 13 ± 0.9 ms and 12 ± 0.4 ms, respectively (mean ± SEM). Four ChRs have particularly slow off-kinetics with toff > 1s, including ChR_15_10, ChR_6_10, and ChR_13_10 (toff = 4.3 ± 0.1 s, 8.0 ± 0.5 s, and 17 ± 7 s, respectively). Two ChRs with very large photocurrents, ChR_25_9 and ChR_11_10, exhibit toff = 220 ± 10 ms and 330 ± 30 ms, respectively.\\nThree designer channelrhodopsins (ChRs) exhibit interesting spectral properties (Figure 2e, Supplemental Figure 5). ChR_28_10's red-shifted spectrum matches that of CsChrimR, demonstrating that incorporating sequence elements from blue-shifted ChRs into CsChrimR can still generate a red-shifted activation spectrum. Two designer ChRs exhibit novel spectral properties: ChR_11_10 has a broad activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with similar steady-state current strength from 400-546 nm light and strong currents (700 ± 100 pA) when activated with 567 nm light. ChR_25_9, on the other hand, exhibits a narrow activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with a peak at 481 nm light.\\n\\nWe assessed the light sensitivity of select designer ChRs. Compared with CsChrimR, CheRiff, and C1C2, the designer ChRs have 9-times larger currents at the lowest intensity of light tested (10^-1 mW mm^2), larger currents at all intensities of light tested, and minimal decrease in photocurrent magnitude over the range of intensities tested (10^-1-10^1 mW mm^2), suggesting that photocurrents were saturated at these intensities and would only attenuate at much lower light intensities (Figure 2d). These select designer ChRs are expressed at levels similar to the CsChrimR parent (the highest expressing parent), indicating that the improved photocurrent strength of these ChRs is not solely due to improved expression (Supplemental Figures 6-7).\\n\\nNat Methods.

The selected designer ChRs produce 3-6 times larger photocurrents than ChR2 (H134R) when exposed to high-intensity (2.2 mW/mm²) 481 nm light and 10-18 times larger photocurrents than ChR2 (H134R) when exposed to low-intensity (6.5x10⁻² mW/mm²) 481 nm light (Supplemental Figure 8f, g).

       "   'suggestedText': 'Many copies of the virus per cell result in very high expression levels of the injected construct. Recently, we described the adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid rAAV-PHP.eB, which produces broad transduction throughout the central nervous system with a single minimally-invasive intravenous injection in the adult mouse. Systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB results in brain-wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections. However, the use of rAAV-PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited by the low multiplicity of infection with systemically delivered viral vectors, resulting in insufficient opsin expression and light-evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly-used channels (e.g., Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)).\\n\\nWe hypothesized that the engineered Channelrhodopsins (ChR gers) could overcome this limitation and allow large-volume optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery. We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChR ger1, ChR ger2, CoChR, or ChR2 (H134R) under the human synapsin (hSyn) promoter and observed broad expression throughout the brain (Figure 3i). We measured the fraction of opsin-expressing cells with sufficient opsin-mediated currents for light-induced firing (Figure 3j). Only 4% of ChR2 (H134R)-expressing neurons produced light-induced firing, while 77% of CoChR-expressing neurons, 89% of ChR ger1-expressing neurons, and 100% of ChR ger2- or ChR ger3-expressing neurons produced light-induced activity. With systemic delivery, we observed superior light sensitivity of ChR gers compared with CoChR in both photocurrent strength (Figure 3k) and spike fidelity (Figure 3l). ChR ger2-expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or ChR2 (H134R)-expressing neurons both in culture and in slice (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 6). These results demonstrate the need for light-sensitive and high-photocurrent opsins for applications where systemic delivery is desired.\\n\\nWe systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging ChR ger1-3 under the CaMKIIα promoter. With systemic delivery of ChR ger2, we observed photocurrent strength similar to results observed after direct injection into the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Figure 3g). When expressed in pyramidal neurons in the cortex, ChR ger2 and ChR ger3 enabled robust optically-induced firing at rates between 2-10 Hz, although spike fidelity was reduced at higher frequency stimulation (Figure 3m, n). ChR ger2 performed best with higher frequency stimulation while ChR ger1 performed worst. CoChR has better spike fidelity than the ChR gers at higher frequency stimulation (20-40 Hz) (Figure 3m).\\nWe next evaluated the optogenetic efficiency of channelrhodopsin ger2 after systemic delivery using optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation (OICSS) of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We systemically delivered recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) PHP.eB packaging a double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) containing either channelrhodopsin ger2 or channelrhodopsin 2 (H134R) into dopamine transporter (Dat)-Cre mice (Figure 4a and Supplemental Table 5).

The main themes include the engineering of ChRs to achieve higher photocurrent strength and light sensitivity, enabling minimally-invasive neuronal activation. The document describes the use of Gaussian Process models to predict and design new ChR variants, resulting in ChRs that can be delivered systemically and activate neurons effectively under low-light conditions. Key participants include researchers from the California Institute of Technology, such as Claire N. Bedbrook, Kevin K. Yang, J. Elliott Robinson, Elisha D. Mackey, Viviana Gradinaru, and Frances H.

       "   'sectionSummary': 'The document focuses on the development and optimization of channelrhodopsins (ChRs) using machine learning techniques for optogenetic applications. The main themes include the engineering of ChRs to enhance their photocurrent strength, light sensitivity, and off-kinetics, enabling minimally-invasive neuronal activation. The purpose is to advance neuroscience research by providing tools that allow for less invasive methods of studying and manipulating brain activity. Key participants in this research include Claire N. Bedbrook, Kevin K. Yang, and other researchers from the California Institute of Technology. The document details the use of machine learning models to predict and design new ChR variants, resulting in ChRs that can be delivered systemically and activate neurons effectively under low-light conditions. The research also includes validation experiments demonstrating the superior performance of these engineered ChRs in both in vitro and in vivo settings.\\n\\nKeywords: machine learning, channelrhodopsin engineering, optogenetics, neuronal activation, California Institute of Technology, Claire N.

The main themes include the engineering of ChRs to enhance their photocurrent strength, light sensitivity, and off-kinetics, enabling minimally-invasive neuronal activation. The purpose is to advance neuroscience research by providing tools that allow for less invasive methods of studying and manipulating brain activity. Key participants in this research include Claire N. Bedbrook, Kevin K. Yang, and other researchers from the California Institute of Technology. The document details the use of machine learning models to predict and design new ChR variants, resulting in ChRs that can be delivered systemically and activate neurons effectively under low-light conditions. The research also includes validation experiments demonstrating the superior performance of these engineered ChRs in both in vitro and in vivo settings.\\n\\ne.g., the 28 top variants.

Current ChR tools applied to the mammalian brain require intracranial surgery for transgene delivery and implantation of invasive fiber-optic cables to produce light-dependent activation of a small volume of tissue. To facilitate expansive optogenetics without the need for invasive implants, our engineering approach leverages the significant literature of ChR variants to train statistical models for the design of new, high-performance ChRs. With Gaussian Process models trained on a limited experimental set of 102 functionally characterized ChRs, we designed high-photocurrent ChRs with unprecedented light sensitivity; three of these, ChR ger1-3, enable optogenetic activation of the nervous system via minimally-invasive systemic transgene delivery, not possible previously due to low per-cell transgene copy produced by systemic delivery. ChR ger2 enables light-induced neuronal excitation without invasive intracranial surgery for virus delivery or fiber optic implantation, i.e., enables minimally-invasive optogenetics.\\n\\n**Introduction**  \\nChannelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated ion channels found in photosynthetic algae.

These channels have broad activation spectra in the visible range and require high-intensity light for activation (approximately 1 mW/mm²). ChRs are naturally low-conductance channels, necessitating the expression of approximately 10^5-10^6 functional ChRs in the plasma membrane of a neuron to produce sufficient light-dependent depolarization to induce neuronal activation. When applied to the mouse brain, ChRs require 1-15 mW light delivered 100 μm from the target cell population to reliably activate action potentials. This confines light-dependent activation to a small volume of brain tissue (approximately 1 mm³). Enabling optogenetics for large brain volumes without the need to implant invasive optical fibers for light delivery would be highly desirable for neuroscience applications.\\n\\nEngineering ChRs to overcome limits in conductance and light sensitivity and extend the reach of optogenetic experiments requires overcoming three major challenges:\\n1. Rhodopsins are transmembrane proteins that are inherently difficult to engineer because the sequence and structural determinants of membrane protein expression and plasma membrane localization are highly constrained and poorly understood.\\n2. Properties of interest for neuroscience applications are assayed using low-throughput techniques, such as patch-clamp electrophysiology, making engineering by directed evolution not feasible.\\n3.

Despite this , it is still not possible to\\n predict functional properties of new ChR sequences .\\nOur approach has been to leverage the significant literature of ChRs to train statistical\\n models that enable design of highly - functional ChRs . These models take as their input the\\n sequence and structural information for a given ChR variant and then predict its functional\\n properties . The models use training data to learn how sequence and structural elements map\\n to ChR function . Once known , that mapping can be used to predict the behavior of untested\\n ChR variants .\\nWe trained models in this manner and found that they accurately predict the properties of\\n untested ChR sequences . We used these models to engineer 30 ' designer ' ChR variants with\\n specific combinations of desired properties , a number of which have unprecedented\\n photocurrent strength and light sensitivity . We characterized these low - light sensitive , high-\\n photocurrent ChRs for applications in the mammalian brain and demonstrate their potential\\n for minimally - invasive activation of populations of neurons in the brain enabled by systemic\\n transgene delivery with the engineered adeno - associated virus ( AAV ) , rAAV - PHP.eB 19.

Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2020 April 14 .\\nBedbrook et al .\\nAuthor\\n Manuscript\\nPage 3\\nResults\\nFunctional characterization of ChR variants for machine learning\\nIn previous work , we explored structure - guided recombination 20,21 of three highly-\\n functional ChR parents [ CSC hrimsonR ( CsChrimR ) 11 , C1C217 , and CheR iff22 ] by designing\\n two 10 - block recombination libraries with a theoretical size of ~ 120,000 ( i.e. 2 × 310 )\\n chimeric variants . These recombination libraries are a rich source of functionally diverse\\n sequences⁹ . Previously , we generated 102 ChR variants selected from these recombination\\n libraries 8,9 , 76 of these were previously characterized for photocurrent properties ( with\\n patch - clamp electrophysiology ) and 26 we characterized here . Together , these 102 ChR\\n recombination variants provide the primary dataset used for model training . We\\n supplemented this dataset with data from other published sources including 19 ChR variants\\n from nature , 14 single - mutant ChR variants , and 28 recombination variants from other\\n libraries ( Dataset 1 ) . As the data produced by other labs were not collected under the same\\n experimental conditions as data collected in our hands , they cannot be used for comparison\\n for absolute ChR properties ( i.e. photocurrent strength ) ; however , these data do provide\\n useful binary information on whether a sequence variant is functional or not . Thus , we used\\n published data from other sources when training binary classification models for ChR\\n function .\\nBecause our goal was to optimize photocurrent strength , wavelength sensitivity , and off-\\n kinetics , we used these measured properties to train machine - learning models ( Figure 1a ) .\\n Enhancing ChR photocurrent strength would enable reliable neuronal activation even under\\n low - light conditions . Different off - rates can be useful for specific applications : fast off-\\n kinetics enable high - frequency optical stimulation 23 , slow off - kinetics is correlated with\\n increased light sensitivity 3,14,15 , and very slow off - kinetics can be used for constant\\n depolarization ( step - function opsins [ SFOS ] 14 ) . In addition to opsin functional properties , it\\n is also necessary to optimize or maintain plasma - membrane localization , a prerequisite for\\n ChR function³ .\\nTraining Gaussian process ( GP ) classification and regression models\"},\n",

For structural\\n comparisons , we convert the 3D crystal - structural information into a ' contact map ' that is\\n convenient for modeling . Two residues are considered to be in contact and potentially\\n important for structural and functional integrity if they have any non - hydrogen atoms within\\n 4.5 Å in the C1C2 crystal structure ( 3UG 9.pdb ) 17.

We then used this trained classification\\n model to predict whether uncharacterized ChR sequence variants were functional ( Figure\\n 1b ) . To test prediction accuracy , we performed 20 - fold cross validation on the training data\\n set and achieved an area under the receiver operator curve ( AUC ) of 0.78 , indicating good\\n predictive power ( Supplemental Table 1 ) .\\nNext , we trained three regression models , one for each of the ChR photocurrent properties of\\n interest : photocurrent strength , wavelength sensitivity of photocurrents , and off - kinetics\\n ( Figure 1c ) . Once trained , these models were used to predict photocurrent properties of new ,\\n untested ChRs sequence variants . To test prediction accuracy , we performed 20 - fold cross\\n validation on the training dataset and observed high correlation between predicted and\\n measured properties for all models ( Pearson correlation [ R ] between 0.77-0.9 ; Supplemental\\n Table 1-2 ) . Models built using contact maps from either the ChR 2 crystal structure 25 or\\n C1Chrimson crystal structure 26 perform as well as models built with a contact map from the\\n C1C2 structure 17 ( Supplemental Table 3 , Supplemental Figure 1c , d ) even though these maps\\n share only 82 % and 89 % of their contacts with the C1C2 map , respectively ( Supplemental\\n Figure 1a , b ) .\\nSelection of designer ChRs using trained models\\nTo select ' designer ' ChRs ( i.e. ChRs predicted to have a useful combination of properties ) ,\\n we used a tiered approach ( Figure 1d ) . First , we eliminated all ChR sequences predicted to\\n not localize to the plasma membrane or predicted to be non - functional . To do this , we used\\n classification models of ChR localization and function to predict the probability of\\n localization and function for each ChR sequence in the 120,000 - variant recombination\\n library . Not surprisingly , most ChR variants were predicted to not localize and not function .\\n To focus on ChR variants predicted to localize and function , we set a threshold for the\\n product of the predicted probabilities of localization and function ( Figure 1b ) ; any ChR\\n sequence above that threshold would be considered for the next tier of the process . We\\n selected a conservative threshold of 0.4 .\\nThe training data made clear that the higher the mutation distance from one of the three\\n parents , the less likely it was that a sequence would be functional ; however , we expect that\\n more diverse sequences would also have the more diverse functional properties . To explore\\n diverse sequences predicted to function , we selected 22 ChR variants that passed the 0.4\\n threshold and were multi - block - swap sequences containing on average 70 mutations from\\n the closest parent . These 22 sequences were synthesized , expressed in HEK cells , and their\\n photocurrent properties were measured with patch - clamp electrophysiology . 59 % of the\\n tested sequences were functional ( Figure 1e ) , compared to 38 % of the multi - block swap\\n sequences randomly selected ( i.e. , not selected by the model ) and having comparable\\n average mutation level . This validates the classification model's ability to make useful\\n predictions about novel functional sequences , even for sequences that are very distant from\\nNat Methods .

For the second tier of the selection process, we used the three regression models trained on all functional variants collected up to this point to predict the photocurrent strength, wavelength sensitivity of photocurrents, and off-kinetics for each of these 1,161 ChR sequence variants (Dataset 3). \\n\\nWe selected 28 designer ChRs predicted to be highly functional with different combinations of properties, including those predicted to have the highest photocurrent strength, most red-shifted or blue-shifted activation wavelengths, and off-kinetics from very fast to very slow (Supplemental Figure 2-3).\\n\\nGenes encoding the 28 selected designer ChR variants were synthesized, expressed in HEK cells, and characterized for their photocurrent properties with patch-clamp electrophysiology. All 28 selected designer ChRs were functional: 100% of variants selected using the updated classification model above the 0.4 threshold both localize and function. For each of the designer ChR variants, the measured photocurrent properties correlated well with the model predictions (R > 0.9 for all models) (Figure 1f, Supplemental Table 1). This outstanding performance on a novel set of sequences demonstrates the power of this data-driven predictive method for engineering designer ChRs.\\n\\nAs a negative control, we selected two ChR variant sequences from the recombination library that the model predicted would be non-functional (ChR_29_10 and ChR_30_10). These sequences resulted from a single-block swap from two of the most highly functional ChR recombination variants tested. As predicted, these sequences were non-functional (Figure 2b), which shows that ChR functionality can be attenuated by incorporating even minimal diversity at certain positions.\\n\\n**Sequence and structural determinants of ChR functional properties**\\nWe used L1-regularized linear regression models to identify a limited set of residues and structural contacts that strongly influence channelrhodopsin (ChR) photocurrent strength, spectral properties, and off-kinetics (Supplemental Figure 4a). We can assess the relative importance of each of these sequence and structural features by weighting their contributions using L2-regularized linear regression (Dataset 4 and Supplemental Figure 4). For each functional property, we identified a set of important residues and contacts and their respective weights. A specific residue or contact at a given position is weighted as likely to lead to, for example, low (negative weight) or high (positive weight) photocurrents.\\n\\nA number of residues and contacts most important for tuning spectral properties are proximal to the retinal-binding pocket, including the blue-shifting contact between alanine at position 206 (A206) and phenylalanine at position 269 (F269), and the blue-shifting contact between phenylalanine at position 265 (F265) and isoleucine at position 267 (I267) that are conserved in the blue-shifted parents C1C2 and Cheriff.

Interestingly, D195 is also part of a contact with L192 that contributes strongly to photocurrent strength (Supplemental Figure 4). A number of contacts proximal to retinal contribute strongly to photocurrent strength. For example, the most heavily weighted contact includes A295 (from CsChrimR), which is adjacent to the conserved lysine residue that covalently links retinal (Supplemental Figure 4). This position is a serine in both C1C2 and CheRiff.\\n\\nMachine-guided search identifies ChRs with a range of useful functional properties. We assessed photocurrent amplitude, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics of the designer ChRs and the three parental ChRs (Figure 2). In addition to the 28 regression model-predicted ChRs, we also assessed the two top-performing ChRs from the classification models' predictions (ChR_9_4 and ChR_25_9), for a total of 30 highly-functional model-predicted ChRs as well as the two negative control ChRs (ChR_29_10, ChR_30_10). Of the 30 model-predicted ChRs, we found 12 variants with 2-times higher blue-light activated photocurrents than the top-performing parent (CsChrimR) (Figure 2b). Three variants exhibit 1.7-times higher green-light activated photocurrents than CsChrimR. Eight variants have larger red-light activated photocurrents when compared with the blue-light activated parents (CheRiff and C1C2), though none out-perform CsChrimR. Both ChR variants predicted to be non-functional by the models produce < 30 pA currents.\\n\\nDesigner ChRs' off-kinetics span three orders of magnitude (toff = 10 ms -> 10 s) (Figure 2c). This range is quite remarkable given that all designer ChRs are built from sequence blocks of three parents that have similar off-kinetics (toff = 30-50 ms). We found that 5 designer ChRs have faster off-kinetics than the fastest parent, while 16 have > 5-times slower off-kinetics. The two fastest variants, ChR_3_10 and ChR_21_10, exhibit toff = 13 ± 0.9 ms and 12 ± 0.4 ms, respectively (mean ± SEM). Four ChRs have particularly slow off-kinetics with toff > 1s, including ChR_15_10, ChR_6_10, and ChR_13_10 (toff = 4.3 ± 0.1 s, 8.0 ± 0.5 s, and 17 ± 7 s, respectively). Two ChRs with very large photocurrents, ChR_25_9 and ChR_11_10, exhibit toff = 220 ± 10 ms and 330 ± 30 ms, respectively.\\nThree designer channelrhodopsins (ChRs) exhibit interesting spectral properties (Figure 2e, Supplemental Figure 5). ChR_28_10's red-shifted spectrum matches that of CsChrimR, demonstrating that incorporating sequence elements from blue-shifted ChRs into CsChrimR can still generate a red-shifted activation spectrum. Two designer ChRs exhibit novel spectral properties: ChR_11_10 has a broad activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with similar steady-state current strength from 400-546 nm light and strong currents (700 ± 100 pA) when activated with 567 nm light. ChR_25_9, on the other hand, exhibits a narrow activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with a peak at 481 nm light.\\n\\nWe assessed the light sensitivity of select designer ChRs.

Interestingly, D195 is also part of a contact with L192 that contributes strongly to photocurrent strength (Supplemental Figure 4). A number of contacts proximal to retinal contribute strongly to photocurrent strength. For example, the most heavily weighted contact includes A295 (from CsChrimR), which is adjacent to the conserved lysine residue that covalently links retinal (Supplemental Figure 4). This position is a serine in both C1C2 and CheRiff.\\n\\nMachine-guided search identifies ChRs with a range of useful functional properties. We assessed photocurrent amplitude, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics of the designer ChRs and the three parental ChRs (Figure 2). In addition to the 28 regression model-predicted ChRs, we also assessed the two top-performing ChRs from the classification models' predictions (ChR_9_4 and ChR_25_9), for a total of 30 highly-functional model-predicted ChRs as well as the two negative control ChRs (ChR_29_10, ChR_30_10). Of the 30 model-predicted ChRs, we found 12 variants with 2-times higher blue-light activated photocurrents than the top-performing parent (CsChrimR) (Figure 2b). Three variants exhibit 1.7-times higher green-light activated photocurrents than CsChrimR. Eight variants have larger red-light activated photocurrents when compared with the blue-light activated parents (CheRiff and C1C2), though none out-perform CsChrimR. Both ChR variants predicted to be non-functional by the models produce < 30 pA currents.\\n\\nDesigner ChRs' off-kinetics span three orders of magnitude (toff = 10 ms -> 10 s) (Figure 2c). This range is quite remarkable given that all designer ChRs are built from sequence blocks of three parents that have similar off-kinetics (toff = 30-50 ms). We found that 5 designer ChRs have faster off-kinetics than the fastest parent, while 16 have > 5-times slower off-kinetics. The two fastest variants, ChR_3_10 and ChR_21_10, exhibit toff = 13 ± 0.9 ms and 12 ± 0.4 ms, respectively (mean ± SEM). Four ChRs have particularly slow off-kinetics with toff > 1s, including ChR_15_10, ChR_6_10, and ChR_13_10 (toff = 4.3 ± 0.1 s, 8.0 ± 0.5 s, and 17 ± 7 s, respectively). Two ChRs with very large photocurrents, ChR_25_9 and ChR_11_10, exhibit toff = 220 ± 10 ms and 330 ± 30 ms, respectively.\\nThree designer channelrhodopsins (ChRs) exhibit interesting spectral properties (Figure 2e, Supplemental Figure 5). ChR_28_10's red-shifted spectrum matches that of CsChrimR, demonstrating that incorporating sequence elements from blue-shifted ChRs into CsChrimR can still generate a red-shifted activation spectrum. Two designer ChRs exhibit novel spectral properties: ChR_11_10 has a broad activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with similar steady-state current strength from 400-546 nm light and strong currents (700 ± 100 pA) when activated with 567 nm light. ChR_25_9, on the other hand, exhibits a narrow activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with a peak at 481 nm light.\\n\\nWe assessed the light sensitivity of select designer ChRs. Compared with CsChrimR, CheRiff, and C1C2, the designer ChRs have 9-times larger currents at the lowest intensity of light tested (10^-1 mW mm^2), larger currents at all intensities of light tested, and minimal decrease in photocurrent magnitude over the range of intensities tested (10^-1-10^1 mW mm^2), suggesting that photocurrents were saturated at these intensities and would only attenuate at much lower light intensities (Figure 2d). These select designer ChRs are expressed at levels similar to the CsChrimR parent (the highest expressing parent), indicating that the improved photocurrent strength of these ChRs is not solely due to improved expression (Supplemental Figures 6-7).\\n\\nNat Methods.

The increased low-light sensitivity of these select designer ChRs is likely due in part to their relatively slow off-kinetics leading to the increased accumulation of the open state under low-light conditions.\\n\\nValidation of designer ChRs for neuroscience applications\\nFor further validation, we selected three of the top high-conductance channelrhodopsins (ChRs): ChR_9_4, ChR_25_9, and ChR_11_10. We renamed them ChR ger1, ChR ger2, and ChR ger3, respectively, for channelrhodopsin Gaussian process-engineered recombinant opsin (Supplemental Figure 9). When expressed in cultured neurons, the ChR gers display robust membrane localization and expression throughout the neuron soma and neurites (Figure 3b). The ChR gers outperform both CoChR and ChR2 (H134R) in photocurrent strength with low-intensity light in neuronal cultures (Figure 3c). The designer ChR gers require 1-2 orders of magnitude lower light intensity than CoChR and ChR2 (H134R) for neuronal activation (Figure 3d, Supplemental Figure 8h).\\n\\nNext, we performed direct intracranial injections into the mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChR ger1-3 or ChR2 (H134R) under the hSyn promoter (Supplemental Table 5). After 3-5 weeks of expression, we measured light sensitivity in ChR-expressing neurons in acute brain slices. We observed greater light sensitivity for the ChR gers compared with ChR2 (H134R) (Figure 3g, h). The ChR gers exhibit >200 pA photocurrent at 10^3 mW/mm^2, while at the equivalent irradiance, ChR2 (H134R) exhibits undetectable photocurrents. The ChR gers reach >1000 pA photocurrents with ~10^2 mW/mm^2 light, a four-fold improvement over ChR2 (H134R)'s irradiance-matched photocurrents (Figure 3g).

       "     'suggestedText': 'Many copies of the virus per cell result in very high expression levels of the injected construct. Recently, we described the adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid rAAV-PHP.eB, which produces broad transduction throughout the central nervous system with a single minimally-invasive intravenous injection in the adult mouse. Systemic delivery of rAAV-PHP.eB results in brain-wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections. However, the use of rAAV-PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited by the low multiplicity of infection with systemically delivered viral vectors, resulting in insufficient opsin expression and light-evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly-used channels (e.g., Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)).\\n\\nWe hypothesized that the engineered Channelrhodopsins (ChR gers) could overcome this limitation and allow large-volume optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery. We systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging either ChR ger1, ChR ger2, CoChR, or ChR2 (H134R) under the human synapsin (hSyn) promoter and observed broad expression throughout the brain (Figure 3i). We measured the fraction of opsin-expressing cells with sufficient opsin-mediated currents for light-induced firing (Figure 3j). Only 4% of ChR2 (H134R)-expressing neurons produced light-induced firing, while 77% of CoChR-expressing neurons, 89% of ChR ger1-expressing neurons, and 100% of ChR ger2- or ChR ger3-expressing neurons produced light-induced activity. With systemic delivery, we observed superior light sensitivity of ChR gers compared with CoChR in both photocurrent strength (Figure 3k) and spike fidelity (Figure 3l). ChR ger2-expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or ChR2 (H134R)-expressing neurons both in culture and in slice (Supplemental Figure 10; Supplemental Table 6). These results demonstrate the need for light-sensitive and high-photocurrent opsins for applications where systemic delivery is desired.\\n\\nWe systemically delivered rAAV-PHP.eB packaging ChR ger1-3 under the CaMKIIα promoter. With systemic delivery of ChR ger2, we observed photocurrent strength similar to results observed after direct injection into the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (Figure 3g). When expressed in pyramidal neurons in the cortex, ChR ger2 and ChR ger3 enabled robust optically-induced firing at rates between 2-10 Hz, although spike fidelity was reduced at higher frequency stimulation (Figure 3m, n). ChR ger2 performed best with higher frequency stimulation while ChR ger1 performed worst. CoChR has better spike fidelity than the ChR gers at higher frequency stimulation (20-40 Hz) (Figure 3m).\\nWe next evaluated the optogenetic efficiency of channelrhodopsin ger2 after systemic delivery using optogenetic intracranial self-stimulation (OICSS) of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We systemically delivered recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) PHP.eB packaging a double-floxed inverted open reading frame (DIO) containing either channelrhodopsin ger2 or channelrhodopsin 2 (H134R) into dopamine transporter (Dat)-Cre mice (Figure 4a and Supplemental Table 5).

Conversely, laser stimulation failed to reinforce operant responding in channelrhodopsin 2 (H134R)-expressing animals (Figure 4a); these results were consistent with results in acute slice where the light-induced currents of channelrhodopsin 2 (H134R) are too weak at the low copy number produced by systemic delivery for robust neuronal activation.\\n\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nAuthor Manuscript\\nNature Methods.

Recently , we described the AAV capsid rAAV - PHP.eB 19 that produces broad\\n transduction throughout the central nervous system with a single minimally - invasive\\n intravenous injection in the adult mouse 30,31 . Systemic delivery of rAAV - PHP.eB results in\\n brain - wide transgene delivery without invasive intracranial injections 19,30,31 . Use of rAAV-\\n PHP.eB for optogenetic applications has been limited , however , by the low multiplicity of\\n infection with systemically delivered viral vectors resulting in insufficient opsin expression\\n and light - evoked currents to control neuronal firing with commonly - used channels ( e.g.\\n ChR 2 ) .\\nWe hypothesized that the ChR gers could overcome this limitation and allow large - volume\\n optogenetic excitation following systemic transgene delivery . We systemically delivered\\n rAAV - PHP.eB packaging either ChR ger1 , ChR ger2 , CoChR , or ChR 2 ( H134R ) under the\\n hSyn promoter and observed broad expression throughout the brain ( Figure 3i ) . We\\n measured the fraction of opsin - expressing cells with sufficient opsin - mediated currents for\\n light - induced firing ( Figure 3j ) . Only 4 % of ChR 2 ( H134R ) -expressing neurons produced\\n light - induced firing , while 77 % of CoC hR - expressing neurons , 89 % of ChR ger1 - expressing\\n neurons , and 100 % of ChR ger2- or ChR ger3 - expressing neurons produced light - induced\\n activity . With systemic delivery , we observed superior light sensitivity of ChR gers compared\\n with CoChR in both photocurrent strength ( Figure 3k ) and spike fidelity ( Figure 31 ) .\\n ChR ger2 - expressing neurons exhibit healthy membrane properties similar to CoChR- or\\n ChR 2 ( H134R ) -expressing neurons both in culture and in slice ( Supplemental Figure 10 ;\\n Supplemental Table 6 ) . These results demonstrate the need for light - sensitive and high-\\n photocurrent opsins for applications where systemic delivery is desired .\\nWe systemically delivered rAAV - PHP.eB packaging ChR ger1-3 under the CaMK IIa\\n promoter . With systemic delivery of ChR ger2 , we observed photocurrent strength similar to\\n results observed after direct injection into the PFC ( Figure 3g ) . When expressed in\\n pyramidal neurons in the cortex , ChR ger2 and ChR ger3 enabled robust optically - induced\\n firing at rates between 2-10 Hz , although spike fidelity was reduced at higher frequency\\n stimulation ( Figure 3m , n ) . ChR ger2 performed best with higher frequency stimulation while\\n ChR ger1 performed worst . C oC hR has better spike fidelity than the ChR gers at higher\\n frequency stimulation ( 20-40 Hz ) ( Figure 3m ) .\\nWe next evaluated the optogenetic efficiency of ChR ger2 after systemic delivery using\\n optogenetic intracranial self - stimulation ( OICSS ) of dopaminergic neurons of the ventral\\n tegmental area ( VTA ) 32. We systemically delivered rA AV - PHP.eB packaging a double-\\n floxed inverted open reading frame ( DIO ) containing either ChR ger2 or ChR 2 ( H134R ) into\\n Dat - Cre mice ( Figure 4a and Supplemental Table 5 ) . Three weeks after systemic delivery\\n and stereotaxic implantation of fiber - optic cannulas above the V TA , mice were placed in an\\n operant box and were conditioned to trigger a burst of 447 nm laser stimulation via nose\\n poke . A nimals expressing ChR ger2 displayed robust optogenetic self - stimulation in a\\n frequency - dependent and laser power - dependent manner . Higher frequencies ( up to 20 Hz )\\n and higher light power ( up to 10 mW ) promoted greater maximum operant response rates\\n ( Figure 4a ) . Conversely , laser stimulation failed to reinforce operant responding in\\n ChR 2 ( H134R ) -expressing animals ( Figure 4a ) ; these results were consistent with results in\\nAuthor\\n Manuscript\\nAuthor\\n Manuscript\\nAuthor\\n Manuscript\\nAuthor\\n Manuscript\\nNat Methods .

For stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), 300 μm outer diameter mono fiber-optic cannulae (Doric Lenses, MFC 300/330-0.37_6mm ZF1.25_FLT) were stereotaxically implanted 200 μm above the VTA bilaterally targeted to the following coordinates: AP, -3.44 mm; ML, ±0.48 mm; DV, -4.4 mm. For stimulation of the right secondary motor cortex (M2), 3 mm long, 400 μm mono fiber-optic cannulae (Doric Lenses, MFC_400/430-0.48_3mm ZF1.25_FLT) were surgically secured to the surface of the skull above M2 (unilaterally) targeted to the following coordinates: AP, 1 mm; ML, 0.5 mm.

The researchers utilized the C1C2 crystal structure (3UG9.pdb) as a reference and assumed that ChR chimeras share the contact architecture observed in this structure. Models built using structural encodings from the ChR2 structure (6EID.pdb) and the C1Chrimson structure (5ZIH.pdb) performed comparably to those using the C1C2 structure (Supplemental Figure 1c, d).

The core topics include the engineering of ChRs to achieve higher photocurrent strength, light sensitivity, and improved off-kinetics, which allows for minimally-invasive neuronal activation without the need for invasive implants. \\n\\n**Introduction:**\\nOptogenetics is a powerful technique that enables precise control of neuronal activity using light. However, current optogenetic tools often require invasive procedures to deliver light to target neurons. To address this limitation, we employed machine learning models to predict and design new ChR variants with enhanced properties.\\n\\n**Methods:**\\nResearchers from the California Institute of Technology, including Claire N. Bedbrook and Kevin K. Yang, utilized Gaussian Process models to guide the engineering of ChRs. These models helped predict the performance of new ChR variants, leading to the development of ChRs that can be delivered systemically and activate neurons effectively under low-light conditions.\\n\\n**Results:**\\nThe engineered ChRs demonstrated superior performance in both in vitro and in vivo settings.

For a detailed description of the GP model architecture used for protein engineering, see references 8 and 24. Briefly, these models infer predictive values for new sequences from training examples by assuming that similar inputs (ChR sequence variants) will have similar outputs (photocurrent properties).

We then used this trained classification model to predict whether uncharacterized ChR sequence variants were functional (Figure 1b).

Not surprisingly, most ChR variants were predicted to not localize and not function. ',\n",

       " 'The training data made clear that the higher the mutation distance from one of the three parents, the less likely it was that a sequence would be functional; however, we expect that more diverse sequences would also have more diverse functional properties. To explore diverse sequences predicted to function, we selected 22 ChR variants that passed the 0.4 threshold and were multi-block-swap sequences containing on average 70 mutations from the closest parent. These 22 sequences were synthesized, expressed in HEK cells, and their photocurrent properties were measured with patch-clamp electrophysiology. ',\n",

       " 'sectionSummary': 'This document, published in \"Nature Methods\" on November 2019 and available in PMC from April 14, 2020, details the development of advanced channelrhodopsins (ChRs) using machine learning to enhance optogenetic applications. The main themes include the engineering of ChRs to achieve higher photocurrent strength and light sensitivity, enabling minimally-invasive neuronal activation. The document describes the use of Gaussian Process models to predict and design new ChR variants, resulting in ChRs that can be delivered systemically and activate neurons effectively under low-light conditions. Key participants include researchers from the California Institute of Technology, such as Claire N. Bedbrook, Kevin K. Yang, J. Elliott Robinson, Elisha D. Mackey, Viviana Gradinaru, and Frances H. Arnold. The purpose of this work is to facilitate expansive optogenetics without the need for invasive implants, significantly advancing neuroscience research.\\n\\nKeywords: machine learning, channelrhodopsin engineering, optogenetics, minimally-invasive techniques, neuronal activation, California Institute of Technology, Claire N.

       " 'suggestedText': \"The following text excerpt:\\n\\n195 is only conserved in CheRiff and C1C2 but not in CsChrimR, which has a cysteine at that position. Interestingly, D195 is also part of a contact with L192 that contributes strongly to photocurrent strength (Supplemental Figure 4). A number of contacts proximal to retinal contribute strongly to photocurrent strength. For example, the most heavily weighted contact includes A295 (from CsChrimR), which is adjacent to the conserved lysine residue that covalently links retinal (Supplemental Figure 4). This position is a serine in both C1C2 and CheRiff.\\n\\nMachine-guided search identifies ChRs with a range of useful functional properties. We assessed photocurrent amplitude, wavelength sensitivity, and off-kinetics of the designer ChRs and the three parental ChRs (Figure 2). In addition to the 28 regression model-predicted ChRs, we also assessed the two top-performing ChRs from the classification models' predictions (ChR_9_4 and ChR_25_9), for a total of 30 highly-functional model-predicted ChRs as well as the two negative control ChRs (ChR_29_10, ChR_30_10). Of the 30 model-predicted ChRs, we found 12 variants with 2-times higher blue-light activated photocurrents than the top-performing parent (CsChrimR) (Figure 2b). Three variants exhibit 1.7-times higher green-light activated photocurrents than CsChrimR. Eight variants have larger red-light activated photocurrents when compared with the blue-light activated parents (CheRiff and C1C2), though none out-perform CsChrimR. Both ChR variants predicted to be non-functional by the models produce < 30 pA currents.\\n\\nDesigner ChRs' off-kinetics span three orders of magnitude (toff = 10 ms -> 10 s) (Figure 2c). This range is quite remarkable given that all designer ChRs are built from sequence blocks of three parents that have similar off-kinetics (toff = 30-50 ms). We found that 5 designer ChRs have faster off-kinetics than the fastest parent, while 16 have > 5-times slower off-kinetics. The two fastest variants, ChR_3_10 and ChR_21_10, exhibit toff = 13 ± 0.9 ms and 12 ± 0.4 ms, respectively (mean ± SEM). Four ChRs have particularly slow off-kinetics with toff > 1s, including ChR_15_10, ChR_6_10, and ChR_13_10 (toff = 4.3 ± 0.1 s, 8.0 ± 0.5 s, and 17 ± 7 s, respectively). Two ChRs with very large photocurrents, ChR_25_9 and ChR_11_10, exhibit toff = 220 ± 10 ms and 330 ± 30 ms, respectively.\\nThree designer channelrhodopsins (ChRs) exhibit interesting spectral properties (Figure 2e, Supplemental Figure 5). ChR_28_10's red-shifted spectrum matches that of CsChrimR, demonstrating that incorporating sequence elements from blue-shifted ChRs into CsChrimR can still generate a red-shifted activation spectrum. Two designer ChRs exhibit novel spectral properties: ChR_11_10 has a broad activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with similar steady-state current strength from 400-546 nm light and strong currents (700 ± 100 pA) when activated with 567 nm light. ChR_25_9, on the other hand, exhibits a narrow activation spectrum relative to the parental spectra, with a peak at 481 nm light.\\n\\nWe assessed the light sensitivity of select designer ChRs. Compared with CsChrimR, CheRiff, and C1C2, the designer ChRs have 9-times larger currents at the lowest intensity of light tested (10^-1 mW mm^2), larger currents at all intensities of light tested, and minimal decrease in photocurrent magnitude over the range of intensities tested (10^-1-10^1 mW mm^2), suggesting that photocurrents were saturated at these intensities and would only attenuate at much lower light intensities (Figure 2d). These select designer ChRs are expressed at levels similar to the CsChrimR parent (the highest expressing parent), indicating that the improved photocurrent strength of these ChRs is not solely due to improved expression (Supplemental Figures 6-7).\\n\\nNat Methods.
