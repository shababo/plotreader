Use LLMs to generate and read plots. Combine them into a teacher-student pair to improve performance.

## Problem

Build a tool that can aggregate information from scientific figures into structured data. For example, extract the functional properities of different variants of opsins - both natual and engineered.

## Approach

Design an agent that takes in a data scenario and paper/figure examples and then outputs structured data, the data plotted into a figure, and several quantitative questions about the figure with difficulty rankings.

Use this agent to train another agent to extract quantitative information from figures using something like TextGrad or DSPy.

## Results

So far I have only implemented the generating agent. Here is an example of it working:

Prompt with both text and example figures.
```Python
generator = PlotGenerator(
        storage_dir = "~/dev/plotreader/storage", 
    )

generator.generate(
    data_scenario = (
        "Scientists are desigining new opsins by mutating existing ones. " +
        "They then measure the currents produced when exciting with different wavelengths of light. " + 
        "They plot comparisons of the different mutants and wild-type as function of these wavelengths."
    ),
    examples_dir='~/dev/plotreader/real_figures/opsins'
)
```

Here is an example figure.
![plot](./real_figures/opsins/opsin_figure_examples.pdf)

And here is the output figure.
