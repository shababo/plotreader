Use LLMs to generate and read plots. Combine them into a teacher-student pair to improve performance.

## Problem

Build a tool that can aggregate information from scientific figures into structured data. For example, extract the functional properities of different variants of opsins - both natual and engineered.

## Approach

Design an agent that takes in a data scenario and paper/figure examples and then outputs structured data, the data plotted into a figure, and several quantitative questions about the figure with difficulty rankings.

Use this agent to train another agent to extract quantitative information from figures using something like TextGrad or DSPy.

## Results

So far I have only implemented the generating agent. Here is an example of some input and output.

### Input

Prompt with both text and example figures.
```Python
generator = PlotGenerator(
        storage_dir = "~/dev/plotreader/storage", 
    )

generator.generate(
    data_scenario = (
        "Scientists are desigining new opsins by mutating existing ones. " +
        "They then measure the currents produced when exciting with different wavelengths of light. " + 
        "They plot comparisons of the different mutants and wild-type as function of these wavelengths."
    ),
    examples_dir='~/dev/plotreader/real_figures/opsins'
)
```

Two of the example figures it was given.

#### Generated Questions
The questions were saved into a `.json` file as
```JSON
[
  {
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "question": "Which opsin variant shows the highest peak photocurrent at the higher light intensity (0.8 mW mm^-2)?",
    "answer": "ChRger1 shows the highest peak photocurrent at the higher light intensity, with a value of approximately 1500 pA."
  },
  {
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "Comparing ChR2 and ChRger3, what is the approximate percentage increase in peak photocurrent at the lower light intensity (8 \u00d7 10^-3 mW mm^-2)?",
    "answer": "At the lower light intensity, ChR2 has a peak photocurrent of about 100 pA, while ChRger3 has a peak photocurrent of about 600 pA. The percentage increase is approximately (600 - 100) / 100 * 100 = 500%. ChRger3 shows a 500% increase in peak photocurrent compared to ChR2 at the lower light intensity."
  },
  {
    "difficulty": "Hard",
    "question": "Based on the spectral sensitivity plot, at which wavelength does the difference in normalized photocurrent between ChRger3 and ChR2 appear to be the greatest, and what is the approximate magnitude of this difference?",
    "answer": "The difference in normalized photocurrent between ChRger3 and ChR2 appears to be greatest at around 480-490 nm. At this point, ChRger3 has a normalized photocurrent of about 0.75, while ChR2 has a normalized photocurrent of about 0.55. The magnitude of the difference is approximately 0.75 - 0.55 = 0.2, or a 20% difference in normalized photocurrent."
  }
]
```

Three `.csv` files were generated that contain the data used to create the figure.
